Approximately 10 minutes after administration of MPA, the animal was removed from the trunk and placed in the right lateral decubitus position, with subsequent trichotomy and antisepsis of the region to be surgically treated. The anesthetic solution consisted of 500 mL Ringer lactate, 1 mg epinephrine and 20 mL 2% lidocaine without vasoconstrictor. The entire solution was administered in the subcutaneous tissue by infiltrative technique, covering the area to be incised. After the anesthetic blockage around the foreskin and penis attachment site, the incision of the skin and subcutaneous tissue was performed. Approximately 0.5 cm of skin was removed from the new site to be implanted at a 45\u00b0 angle, and the skin was sutured with Wolff stitches of non-absorbable material. The Tumescent Anesthetic Technique (TAT) was performed successfully since the animal had a good recovery without adverse effects. As described in the literature, the incised areas showed a tiny amount of bleeding. Its analgesic effect could also be observed postoperatively by the animal behavior and ease when cleaning the wound. The physiological parameters (HR 58 \u00b1 2 and f 22 \u00b1 4) were within normal limits for the species at surgery, remaining constant until the end of the procedure.

We examined 220 patients with cervical otorhinolaryngological disorders (100 patients with dizziness, 49 with hearing impairment,47 with tinnitus and 24 with dysphonia) after cervical manipulation lasting more than 6 months. Results and conclusions. The extraordinary satisfaction with the manipulative therapy in 82% of patients with dizziness (46% total relief, 36% high improvement) reflects the high efficiency of this manual therapy.

The overactive bladder-questionnaire (OAB-q) was used to assess the OAB symptom severity. Results: The mean score of OAB symptom severity was 35.48 out of 100. Participants showed the highest score of urgency among OAB symptoms. The significant predictors were the monthly income, operation history of urogynecology, and body mass index accounting for 23% of the variance of OAB symptom severity. The OAB symptom severity was higher in subjects who had lower monthly income, urogynecology operation history and higher BMI (\uff1e25 \u338f/\u33a1). Conclusion: The findings of this study demonstrate that it should be considered to recommend weight loss as a component of nursing intervention for alleviating OAB symptom severity in overweight OAB patients.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2461217568", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:77496281"}

In order to outline a treatment plan specifically devised for elderly pts with a reduced amount of chemotherapy, we investigated the efficacy and safety of a brief chemo-immunotherapy FND plus Rituximab. Patients and methods: from March 1999 to March 2003, 80 elderly pts (age >60) with advanced stage FL at diagnosis were enrolled. Treatment plan was: 4 courses of FND (Fludarabine 25 mg/m 2 days 1\u20133, Mitoxantrone 10 mg/m 2 day 1 and Dexamethasone 20 mg days 1\u20133) followed by 4 Rituximab infusions at 375 mg/m 2 /week; pts in partial remission received 2 further FND and 2 Rituximab infusions. PCR molecular monitoring for the presence of IgH/Bcl2 and/or Ig heavy chain gene rearrangement was performed at the beginning of the treatment, after FND, after Rituximab and during follow-up time on bone marrow (BM) samples. Results: median age was 66 (range 60\u201378); 42 males and 38 females; 16% had stage II, 12% stage III and 72% stage IV disease; 61% had BM involvement; 41% had bulky disease and 24% were at high risk according to IPI score. PCR molecular analysis was performed in 46 pts at diagnosis: 63% were Bcl2 rearranged and 37% were not; IgH rearrangement was detected in 24% of Bcl2 negative pts. Up to date, 70 pts are evaluable. Overall response at the end of treatment was achieved in 63 pts (90%) with 58 pts (83%) in complete remission (CR) and 5 pts (7%) in partial remission (PR). Six pts (9%) did not respond and one patient (1%) died of neutropenic sepsis during a FND course. The addition of Rituximab allowed to increase CR rate from 44% (31 pts) after FND to 83% (58 pts); 73% of responding pts did so with a brief treatment program (4 FND + 4 Rituximab). Patients with adverse prognostic features at diagnosis responded as well as those with more favorable ones with no significant differences in CR rates: BM+ 89%, BM- 79%; low IPI 83%, high IPI 82%; Bulky+ 85%, Bulky- 79%; stage II 90%, III 87%, IV 84%. A thorough molecular analysis is ongoing; to date a molecular marker was detectable in 26 pts. After FND 9/26 pts (35%) did not show anymore BM molecular disease, while PCR negativity was achieved in 23/26 pts (88%) after Rituximab treatment. With a median follow-up of 30 months, 3-yr failure free survival was 50% for the whole series of pts. Failures were observed more frequently in PCR+ pts: all 3 PCR+ pts failed compared to only 7/23 PCR- pts (p=.01). The toxicity was mild with grade 3\u20134 neutropenia reported in 22% of FND courses, but only 3 pts developed grade 3\u20134 infections. The whole program was performed in an outpatient setting. Rituximab toxicity was as expected. Conclusions: a brief course of chemo-immunotherapy is able to achieve high clinical and molecular response rates in elderly pts with low toxicity. The sequential use of FND and Rituximab induces a CR rate >80% also in unfavorable subsets of pts. The achievement of PCR negative status correlates with a lower risk of failure.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1182/blood.v104.11.1320.1320", "venue": null, "journal": "Blood", "mag_id": "2465205173", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:77497951"}

By whatever method obtained, solutions of titanium salts, with the possible exception of the oxalates, are more or less unstable due to their tendency to hydrolyze. In order even partially to prevent hy~lys1s of titanium chloride and sulfate solutions it is necessary to maintain high acid concentrations and to keep temperatures low. ~nerally, with low acid concentrations and especially with application of heat, hydrolysis wUl occur. Much of the titanium wlll separate as relatively inert dioxide.

This case study examines the benefits to corporations from participating in this programme in terms of the programme's influence on relationships with key corporate stakeholders including employees, host communities, environmental groups and regulators. The method of the study was a survey of individuals responsible for wildlife habitat enhancement programmes at 164 sites in the United States. Ninety-five percent of respondents indicated that wildlife habitat programmes led to improved employee morale. Seventy-two percent indicated improved relationships with environmental groups. Sixty percent of respondents noted a positive effect of the programme on community relations. Forty-nine percent of respondents reported an improved relationship with regulators. These benefits were in addition to the 50% of programmes that reported annual cost savings. The study also identifies specific benefits to the wildlife programme as a result of outside group involvement. Relationships with community, Government, and environmental groups led to better wildlife programmes due to increased expertise. Furthermore, 24% of the wildlife monitoring was done by outside groups. These results are useful, both for aiding managers to identify the range of benefits the wildlife habitat enhancement programme can provide to their companies, as well as to improve their organization's wildlife and biodiversity protection.

Two distinct hydrolysis and condensation conditions were employed, followed by drying and thermal treatment up to 1000 \u00b0C. Product composition and oxide phase transitions were characterised by powder X-ray diffractometry and Raman, electron paramagnetic resonance, Mossbauer and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopies. A mixture of nanometric-size TiO 2 (anatase, 3.6\u20135.8 nm) and amorphous iron(III) oxide was obtained up to 500 \u00b0C, while TiO 2 (rutile), \u03b1-Fe 2 O 3 (hematite) and Fe 2 TiO 5 (pseudobrookite) were found at 700 \u00b0C.

In addition, 2015 saw a 10 percent increase in international students in the U.S., a statistic that underscores the assumption that globally mobile students regard the U.S. as a destination of choice (IIE, 2015). In the fall of 2015, 1,758 Chinese students were studying at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) (University of Pittsburgh Fact Book, 2016). ::: The number of Chinese alumni will increase as these matriculated students graduate from U.S. universities. However, Chinese alumni university philanthropy has lagged behind domestic and international alumni philanthropy (Zi, 2014). The need for private philanthropy is clear. Higher education in the United States is in a financial crisis. Decreased funding from state and federal governments combined with rising costs have led higher education institutions to enhance efforts to raise funds from private philanthropic sources (Pew Charitable Trust, 2015). ::: In order to develop a philanthropic relationship between Chinese students and their U.S. host institutions, it is necessary to understand their student experience. Very little is known about this population by university departments that regularly interact with Chinese students, including the Office of International Services (OIS) at Pitt. OIS works closely with all international students during their tenure at university and is responsible for securing a student\u2019s Optional Practical Training (OPT) following graduation. Institutional Advancement (IA), the fundraising arm of a university, also has a vested interest in better understanding Chinese students. ::: This study employs a mixed-methods research design that employs a survey with Likert-style and open-ended responses. It asks Pitt\u2019s Chinese alumni about their experiences as undergraduate or graduate students. The findings may help universities better serve Chinese students and develop strong alumni ties. The two key findings from this study found that predictors of Chinese students\u2019 overall satisfaction and thus future engagement potential were (1) tied to students\u2019 ability to gain work or career building skills through their classes, a university teaching experience, and/or internships, and (2) students\u2019 satisfaction with their interaction with OIS is tied to the amount of time allocated to their appointments.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2923138373", "mag_field_of_study": ["Political Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:159351980"}

Using administrative pension insurance records from Germany, it studies the impact of a pension subsidy program on retirement decisions of recipients. The kinked schedule of the policy allows me to identify the causal effect using a regression kink design. The estimation suggests that 100 euros in additional monthly pension benefits induce female recipients to claim pensions earlier by about 10 months. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the ratio of the behavioral cost to the mechanical cost of this subsidy program is 0.3, which is smaller than that of other anti-poverty programs. The second chapter studies the total labor supply effects of Unemployment Insurance (UI) for older workers \u2013 both at the extensive and the intensive margin. It documents sharp bunchings in UI inflows at age discontinuities created by UI eligibility for workers in their 50s. Using a combination of regression discontinuity designs and bunching techniques, we quantify the magnitude of these responses exploiting a variety of thresholds, kinks, and notches induced by the UI and retirement institutions. We estimate the total effect using a dynamic life-cycle structural model. Results suggest that the impact of UI extension on non-employment durations for older workers is almost twice as large as the impact for younger workers. The third chapter examines the impact of receiving written advance notification of layoff on the labor supply of displaced workers by exploring the California Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. The California WARN Act, implemented in 2003, expands the requirements of the federal WARN Act. It provides protection to workers in smaller firms and at smaller layoff events. Using the Displaced Worker Supplement to the Current Population Surveys from 1996 to 2018 and a differences-in-difference method, I find that the displaced workers affected by the mini WARN Acts are 3\\% more likely to claim unemployment insurance. Conditional on claiming UI, they are less likely to exhaust UI.", "year": 2018, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2911563731", "mag_field_of_study": ["Economics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:159358222"}

Other Contacts IV. THE TRANSACTIONAL NEXUS TEST V. CONCLUSION I. INTRODUCTION With the rise of large mail-order companies such as L.L. Bean and the Home Shopping Network, the mail-order industry in the United States is expanding rapidly.(1) Small businesses are facing increased competition as more and more consumers choose to purchase merchandise from mail-order firms.(2) This growth is, in part, attributable to consumers' ability to evade state sales and use taxes when mail-order companies do not collect them.(3) Local businesses, which must collect sales tax on most retail sales, are at a disadvantage to the extent that their customers cannot realize the same cost savings. In addition, states lose billions of dollars in annual revenue due to their inability to collect taxes on out-of-state sales.(4) This situation stems from the differences between sales and use taxes. Because the dormant Commerce Clause prohibits taxation of out-of-state transactions, states cannot tax sales occurring outside of their borders.(5) Therefore, to protect local businesses and state tax revenue, states that impose a sales tax on purchases made within their borders also impose a compensating use tax on outside purchases consumed within the state.(6) The subject of the use tax is an in-state transaction, the use of the product within the state, rather than an outside sale. The use tax thus \"complement[s] the sales tax\" by \"fill[ing] gaps where the States could not constitutionally impose a sales tax.\"(7) States generally impose both sales and use taxes on the consumer,(8) but enforcing use tax collection is difficult. While states rely on in-state retail vendors to collect and remit the sales tax,(9) the Due Process and Commerce Clauses restrict their ability to impose a use tax collection obligation on out-of-state retailers.(10) Thus, when the out-of-state retailers do not collect the use tax, consumers can realize a savings relative to similar purchases made within the state.(11) Out-of-state vendors have resisted collecting the use tax on Due Process(12) and Commerce Clause(13) grounds.(14) These provisions of the United States Constitution allow a state to impose use tax collection obligations only on businesses that have a certain nexus with the state.(15) The Due Process Clause requires minimum contacts with the taxing state, while the dormant Commerce Clause requires a substantial nexus with the state.(16) Since Quill Corp. v. North Dakota,(17) only the dormant Commerce Clause substantial nexus requirement mandates that a mail-order vendor (also referred to as a \"direct marketer\") have a physical presence within a state before that state can require it to collect use taxes.(18) The existence of \"`retail outlets, solicitors, or property within a State'\" generally amounts to physical presence, but contacts solely by \"`mail or common carrier'\" are insufficient.(19) The Due Process Clause, according to Quill, does not require that a direct marketer be physically present in the state and, therefore, contacts by mail or common carrier may be sufficient to meet the due process minimum contacts nexus requirement.(20) The concept of physical presence, then, remains important under the Commerce Clause. However, Quill only clarified that contacts made solely by mail or common carrier, regardless of the extent of solicitation within the state, do not amount to physical presence.(21) This Comment explores the contacts that do satisfy the physical presence requirement. \u2026", "year": 1996, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": "Albany law review", "mag_id": "243598913", "mag_field_of_study": ["Business"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:159358512"}

This is similar to the 30:70 ratio of adult blue and green R8 cells. However, the stochastic choice of adult color PRs and the bistable loop of the warts and melted tumor suppressor genes that unambiguously specify rh5 and rh6 in R8 PRs are not involved in specification of larval PRs. Instead, primary PR precursors signal via EGFR to surrounding tissue to develop as secondary precursors, which will become Rh6-expressing PRs. EGFR signaling is required for the survival of the Rh6 subtype. Primary precursors give rise to the Rh5 subtype. Furthermore, the combinatorial action of the transcription factors Spalt, Seven-up, and Orthodenticle specifies the two PR subtypes. Therefore, even though the larval PRs and adult R8 PRs express the same rhodopsins (rh5 and rh6), they use very distinct mechanisms for their specification.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC1950857", "pubmed_id": "17785526", "doi": "10.1101/gad.1565407", "venue": "Genes & development", "journal": "Genes & development", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2111121145", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["3239892", "16136920", "21926238", "6776383", "24243770", "1653710", "2927625", "14006830", "2738368", "12389921", "7313952", "26064810", "13295688", "24868933", "4980890", "38371869", "14084538", "10169222", "22846431", "31640257", "12838277", "12962397", "5808703", "26116881", "11045288", "24568065", "14067551", "9568853", "6921311", "6632308", "13427369", "16869461", "4426584", "38928656", "86925", "6535460", "23194626", "27219420", "1888229", "24976004", "18791028", "11479978", "29423415", "14985756", "25263392", "22661344", "19604448", "40199283", "1211520", "1057283", "196706"], "inbound_citations": ["201966468", "16579577", "14667576", "20024434", "13446654", "50784578", "4465846", "214988023", "17616742", "14391710", "14258948", "11628401", "4306020", "162183915", "1713899", "5018092", "4627419", "215173581", "15331212", "25754679", "215645719", "8326281", "9280598", "25303211", "443185", "7755633", "9795406", "5927657", "2558988", "24192488", "4654345"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:18980463"}

Gap junctions in vertebrates are composed of connexons, which are an assembly of six proteins, connexins. Docking of two connexons on the opposite cell surfaces forms a gap junction between the cytoplasm of two neighboring cells. Connexins compose a family of structurally related four-pass transmembrane proteins. In mammals, there are approximately 20 connexins, each of which contributes to unique permeability of gap junctions, and mutations of some connexin-encoding genes are associated with human diseases. Zebrafish has been predicted to contain 39 connexin-encoding genes; the high number can be attributed to gene duplication during fish evolution, which resulted in diversified functions of gap junctions in teleosts. The determination of body shapes and skin patterns in animal species is an intriguing question. Mathematical models suggest principle mechanisms explaining the diversification of animal morphology. Recent studies have revealed the involvement of gap junctions in fish morphological diversity, including skin pattern formation and body shape determination.

Objective: To explore whether inducing the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) via synchronous multisensory visuo-tactile bodily stimulation may reveal any perceptual correlates of plastic remapping in SCI. Methods: In 16 paraplegic, 16 tetraplegic and 16 healthy participants we explored whether RHI may be induced by tactile stimuli involving not only the left hand but also the left hemi-face. Touching the participant\u2019s actual hand or face was either synchronous or asynchronous with tactile stimuli seen on a rubber hand. We assessed two components of the illusion, namely perceived changes in the real hand in space (indexed by proprioceptive drift) and ownership of the rubber hand (indexed by subjective responses to an ad-hoc questionnaire). Results: Proprioceptive drift and ownership were found in the healthy group only in the condition where the left real and fake hand were touched simultaneously. In contrast, no drift was found in the SCI patients who, however, showed ownership after both synchronous and asynchronous hand stroking. Importantly, only tetraplegics showed the effect also after synchronous face stroking. Conclusions: RHI may reveal plastic phenomena in SCI. In hand representation-deprived tetraplegics, stimuli on the face (represented contiguously in the somatic and motor systems), drive the sense of hand ownership.

The Steiner interval $I(W)$ of $W$ consists of all vertices in $G$ that lie on some Steiner tree with respect to $W$.

We present results from an in-depth study of ant behavior in a quest for a robust algorithm.

These concepts have been successfully demonstrated with a handful of near to mid-term traffic demand scenarios and technologies using spacing buffers as low as 0.3 nmi.

One of structured models, Gaussian Conditional Random Fields (GCRF), utilizing multiple unstructured models to learn the non-linear relationships between node attributes and the structured response variable, achieves high prediction accuracy. However, it does not scale well with large networks. We propose a novel model, called Scalable Approximate GCRF (SA-GCRF), which integrates weighted attributed network compression with GCRF, with the aim of making GCRF applicable to large networks. The model consists of three steps: first, it compresses a network into a smaller one by generalizing nodes into supernodes and edges into superedges; then, it applies GCRF to the reduced network; and finally, it unfolds the predicted response variables into the original nodes. Our hypothesis is that the reduced network maintains most information of the original network such that the loss in prediction accuracy obtained by GCRF on the reduced network is minor. The comprehensive experimental results indicate that SA-GCRF was 150\u2013520 times faster than standard GCRF and 11\u201329 times faster than state-of-the-art UmGCRF on large networks, and provided regression results where GCRF and UmGCRF were not applicable.

Although leptospirosis is a life-threatening disease and recognized as an important cause of pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome, the lack of global estimates for morbidity and mortality has contributed to its neglected disease status. ::: ::: Methodology/Principal Findings ::: ::: We conducted a systematic review of published morbidity and mortality studies and databases to extract information on disease incidence and case fatality ratios. Linear regression and Monte Carlo modelling were used to obtain age and gender-adjusted estimates of disease morbidity for countries and Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and WHO regions. We estimated mortality using models that incorporated age and gender-adjusted disease morbidity and case fatality ratios. The review identified 80 studies on disease incidence from 34 countries that met quality criteria. In certain regions, such as Africa, few quality assured studies were identified. The regression model, which incorporated country-specific variables of population structure, life expectancy at birth, distance from the equator, tropical island, and urbanization, accounted for a significant proportion (R2 = 0.60) of the variation in observed disease incidence. We estimate that there were annually 1.03 million cases (95% CI 434,000\u20131,750,000) and 58,900 deaths (95% CI 23,800\u201395,900) due to leptospirosis worldwide.

The treatment of time-irreversible evolution (the arrow of time) is therefore ruled out by definition in Quantum Mechanics. In Quantum Field Theory it is, however, possible to describe time-irreversible evolution by resorting to the existence of infinitely many unitarily inequivalent representations of the canonical commutation relations (ccr). In this paper I review such a result by discussing the canonical quantization of the damped harmonic oscillator (dho), a prototype of dissipative systems. The irreversibility of time evolution is expressed as tunneling among the unitarily inequivalent representations. Canonical quantization is shown to lead to time dependent SU(1,1) coherent states. The exact action for the dho is derived in the the path integral formalism of the quantum Brownian motion developed by Schwinger and by Feynman and Vernon. The doubling of the phase-space degrees of freedom for dissipative systems is related to quantum noise effects.

Patients who had failed a first mobilization attempt with chemotherapy plus rhG-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg/d) were remobilized with chemotherapy plus rhG-CSF and rhGH (100 \u03bcg/kg/d). As compared with rhG-CSF, the combined rhGH/rhG-CSF treatment induced significantly higher ( P \u2264 .05) median peak values for CD34+ cells/\u03bcL (7 versus 29), colony-forming cells (CFCs)/mL (2154 versus 28 510), and long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs)/mL (25 versus 511).

The most notable features here are that an agent is allowed to be indifferent between certain alternatives and indecisive about others.

The aim with this study was to describe the clinical presentation of A sanguinicola bacteremia and to determine the antibiotic susceptibility and the capacity of the bacteria to form biofilm and to induce platelet aggregation. ::: ::: ::: METHODS ::: Isolates of A sanguinicola from blood cultures were retrospectively identified from 2 clinical microbiology laboratories for 2006 to 2012. Species identity was confirmed through sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The medical charts of patients were reviewed. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for relevant antibiotics was determined. Biofilm formation was measured as the amount of crystal violet absorbed. Platelet aggregation was determined by aggregometry. ::: ::: ::: RESULTS ::: Eleven cases of A sanguinicola bacteremia were identified. All patients were male and the median age was 82 years (range 67-93). Nine patients fulfilled criteria for severe sepsis, and 2 patients died at hospital. Two patients were diagnosed with infective endocarditis. Most patients had underlying urinary tract diseases or an indwelling urinary tract catheter. Five patients suffered from dementia. None of the patients was treated with immunosuppressive medications. The MIC values of the isolates were in line with previous reports, with low MICs for penicillin, cefotaxime, and vancomycin.

This work shows that doing so can be inefficient due to user heterogeneity in how the delays impact QoE. From the perspective of QoE, the sensitivity of a request to delays can vary greatly even among identical requests arriving at the service, because they differ in the wide-area network latency experienced prior to arriving at the service. In other words, saving 50ms of server-side delay affects different users differently. This paper presents E2E, the first resource allocation system that embraces user heterogeneity to allocate server-side resources in a QoE-aware manner. Exploiting this heterogeneity faces a unique challenge: unlike other application-level properties of a web request (e.g., a user's subscription type), the QoE sensitivity of a request to server-side delays cannot be pre-determined, as it depends on the delays themselves, which are determined by the resource allocation decisions and the incoming requests. This circular dependence makes the problem computationally difficult. We make three contributions: (1) a case for exploiting user heterogeneity to improve QoE, based on end-to-end traces from Microsoft's cloud-scale production web framework, as well as a user study on Amazon MTurk; (2) a novel resource allocation policy that addresses the circular dependence mentioned above; and (3) an efficient system implementation with almost negligible overhead. We applied E2E to two open-source systems: replica selection in Cassandra and message scheduling in RabbitMQ. Using traces and our testbed deployments, we show that E2E can increase QoE (e.g., duration of user engagement) by 28%, or serve 40% more concurrent requests without any drop in QoE.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1145/3341302.3342089", "venue": "SIGCOMM '19", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2968056872", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["2360392", "2862419", "3334152", "8161676", "52985662", "7381414", "7328163", "1617028", "7121919", "4842331", "2674241", "5661499", "18126684", "2534011", "14607360", "7904683", "9729057", "701296", "2747585", "8579892", "7806079", "2401053", "10750519", "150387498", "6769302", "361695", "10753850", "207927251", "15164882", "3927627", "14292725", "14713407", "14892955", "177776", "5793954", "17203404", "14065129", "16307795", "7466159", "885151", "1491158"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199661662"}

Network operators are also able to collect more data to improve network performance and user experience. In this paper we concentrate on modeling performance of wireless cells using hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework. This framework provides a principled way to navigate the space between the option of creating one model to represent all cells in a network and the option of creating separate models at each cell. The former option ignores the variations between cells (complete pooling) whereas the latter is overly noisy and ignores the common patterns in cells (no pooling). Hierarchical Bayesian modeling strikes a trade-off between these two extreme cases and enables us to do partial pooling of the data from all cells. This is done by estimating a parametric population distribution and assuming that each cell is a sample from this distribution. Because this model is fully Bayesian, it provides uncertainty intervals around each estimated parameter which can be used by network operators making network management decisions.

Reviewers extracted, coded, and analyzed key data including definitions of trust and factors pertaining to group trust. The authors selected 42 articles for full text review. Although reviewers found multiple general definitions of trust, they were unable to find a clear definition of group trust and propose the following: a group-directed willingness to accept vulnerability to actions of the members based on the expectation that members will perform a particular action important to the group, encompassing social exchange, collective perceptions, and interpersonal trust. Additionally, the authors propose a model encompassing individual level factors (trustor and trustee), interpersonal interactions, group level factors (structure and processes), and environmental factors.

However, few of the studies with a small number of patients had tested the effect of hypercholesterolemia on the outcomes and complications among acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. We hypothesized that lipid disorders (LDs), though risk factors for AIS, were associated with better outcomes and fewer post-stroke complications. Materials and Method: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (years 2003\u20132014) in adult hospitalizations for AIS to determine the outcomes and complications associated with LDs, using ICD-9-CM codes. In 2014, we also aimed to estimate adjusted odds of AIS in patients with LDs compared to patients without LDs. The multivariable survey logistic regression models, weighted to account for sampling strategy, were fitted to evaluate relationship of LDs with AIS among 2014 hospitalizations, and outcomes and complications amongst AIS patients from 2003\u20132014. Results and Conclusions: In 2014, there were 28,212,820 (2.02% AIS and 5.50% LDs) hospitalizations. LDs patients had higher prevalence and odds of having AIS compared with non-LDs. Between 2003\u20132014, of the total 4,224,924 AIS hospitalizations, 451,645 (10.69%) had LDs. Patients with LDs had lower percentages and odds of mortality, risk of death, major/extreme disability, discharge to nursing facility, and complications including epilepsy, stroke-associated pneumonia, GI-bleeding and hemorrhagic-transformation compared to non-LDs.

However, to date little systematic research has been undertaken on tribal culture and its interactions with militant Islamist groups.

A measure of this sort would assist in the exploration of relationships between tribalism and militant Islam, religiously motivated violence, or the export of that violence. In this article, we put forward such a measure, the Tribalism Index. This Tribalism Index is a predictor of religiously motivated violence, and is effective in parsing the varying relationships of Islam, Islamist militancy and tribal patriarchy to that violence. It is also helpful in predicting religiously motivated violence in diaspora communities in Western nations, and has proved effective in doing so in the United Kingdom. Regression models that include both Muslim population percentage and level of tribalism demonstrate that, in the absence of a clear tribal culture, adherence to Islam does not make for susceptibility to extremism. Furthermore, these models show that it is within tribal environments that Islamist movements are best nurtured. The Tribalism Index proves of greater utility than the Failed States Index for eliciting the dynamics of violence in tribal societies, while illuminating the inaccuracy of seeing militancy as a function of Islam as such.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1515/1940-0004.1149", "venue": null, "journal": "New Global Studies", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": ["145753289", "108197257"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199664457"}

One argument for implementing strong patent rights in developing countries is that doing so will attract high technology exports from industrialized countries, which should consequently lead to economic growth. However, the impact of patent rights on high technology exports is not identical across all industries. This paper postulates that the role of developing country patent rights in increasing high technology imports depends on the production and adaptation costs of foreign innovating firms, and the usefulness of the high technology good in developing country production processes. When the cost of adapting a foreign innovation for use in developing countries is relatively low, and when the innovation is highly useful in the domestic production processes of developing countries, strengthening patent protection has little impact on attracting foreign innovations. However, when the cost of adapting the good for use in developing countries is relatively high, patent protection can be used as a policy tool to limit competition, raise the price received by innovating firms, and, ultimately, attract foreign high technology goods from abroad.", "year": 2012, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1515/1524-5861.1785", "venue": null, "journal": "Global Economy Journal", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": ["153073248", "53371260", "154819725", "154994111", "54958462", "151253144", "153846267", "154717580", "201124196", "154488500"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199664595"}

Currency depreciation hurts real GDP for Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Uruguay and Venezuela whereas the real exchange rate and real GDP exhibit a backward-bending relationship for Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Peru, suggesting that currency depreciation increases real GDP in early years whereas currency appreciation raises real GDP in recent years. Except for Bolivia and Paraguay, a higher global interest rate reduces real GDP. Expansionary fiscal policy is effective for Argentina, Mexico and Paraguay.

We compare the professors\u2019 salaries to those in leading occupations in private business, as well as state bureaucracy and find that relative income level developed in a similar fashion up to the 1970s. The 1970s were identified as a crucial turning point, as university professors started to fall behind their comparative social groups in alternative job markets. Making use of the literature on relative income, the article suggests the university professors changed their group of comparison in questions of remuneration during the course of the 20th century, so that the decreasing internal income-inequality affected their well-being more than the increasing gap to salaries outside universities.", "year": 2013, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1524/jbwg.2013.0007", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199665266"}

This review explores the current literature regarding multidrug-resistant UTIs in childhood and proposes an approach to management. Multidrug-resistant organisms include a wide range of potential urinary tract pathogens and, while most literature on drug resistance in UTIs during childhood has focused on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing organisms, in this review, we have included a discussion of multidrug resistance including and beyond beta-lactamase production. We provide definitions for multidrug-resistant organisms in line with current consensus guidelines and summarise clinically relevant mechanisms of resistance. Additionally, in this review, we outline the global epidemiology of multidrug-resistant UTIs in children, summarising published prevalence rates, which range from 5 to 90% in different settings. Finally, we also critically review the evidence on risk factors for colonisation and infection of the urinary tract with multidrug-resistant organisms, including prior antibiotic use, hospitalisation and underlying urological malformations. We also highlight multidrug-resistant UTI occurring in children without any identifiable risk factors, reflecting an increasing prevalence of colonisation with these organisms in the general community. Taken as a whole, this emphasises a need for careful and evidence-based use of antibiotics when treating UTIs in children and, to aide clinicians, we have outlined here potential management strategies for when infection with a multidrug-resistant organism is suspected or confirmed.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "31418063", "doi": "10.1007/s00467-019-04316-5", "venue": "Pediatric Nephrology", "journal": "Pediatric Nephrology", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2967565993", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["205819612", "574252", "33469990", "25961436", "19049799", "8780127", "205152842", "33518872", "2400421", "14505750", "206427811", "215592968", "205690629", "3000", "3816538", "51717844", "23220152", "19060438", "35694557", "18419641", "206384301", "12009572", "206861016", "15612246", "49607266", "38529040", "31205238", "3776846", "20623783", "58948264", "14290522", "35575535", "7654496", "215198906", "52193493", "3651161", "4384924", "3864952", "5395844", "4084158", "205697621", "14836560", "45047428", "24830950", "12905907", "21131889", "42392515", "33202483", "25888776", "22971908", "44838033", "47539442"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:199668067"}

Exceptional physiological, morphological, biochemical and behavioural adaptations allow the fish to tolerate the harsh environmental conditions that exist in the locations, the most extreme milieus occupied by a species of fish on Earth. The temperature of the water is inordinately high for a fish; large diurnal fluctuations in the levels of the partial pressure of oxygen occur, with acute hypoxia happening during the night and hyperoxia during the day; the salinity of the water is ~60% of that of seawater and; the pH may be as high as 11. Having an average adult body length of less than 6 cm and a body mass of ~5 g, the fish is very small in size. Here, body mass, body length, condition factors (CFs) and sex ratios (SRs) were determined on fish sampled from nine accessible isolated populations. Except for the Cement Water Holding Tanks (CWHT) population, where the female-to-male SR was 4:1, overall, the number of male fish surpassed the female ones by a ratio of ~2:1. The male fish were heavier and longer compared to the female ones. The relatively lower ambient temperature in the CWHT (32 \u00b0C) may explain the female dominated population and the effect future increase in temperature may have on sex distribution in the various populations of A. grahami. In fish from the Fish Spring Lagoons B and D, the CFs were greater in the male fish relative to the female ones. Exhibiting poor-to-fair body states, the CFs of the different populations of A. grahami, that ranged from 1.1. to 1.8, were among the lowest that have been reported in fish living under natural setting. The skewed SRs and the markedly low CFs of A. grahami reported here may be ascribed to the harsh (stressful) environmental conditions the fish contends with.

Certainly, its most prominent device is the smartphone due to its wide proliferation, growing computation power, and wireless networking capabilities. In this context, we revisit the implementation of digitalized word-of-mouth that suggests exchanging item preferences between smartphones offline and directly in immediate proximity. Collaboratively and decentrally collecting data in this way has two benefits. First, it allows to attach for instance location-sensitive context information in order to enrich collected item preferences. Second, model building does not require network connectivity. Despite the benefits, the approach naturally raises data privacy and data scarcity issues.

Semisupervised learning (SSL) methods provide promising solutions to address the aforementioned issue. Graph-based SSL algorithms, also called label propagation methods, have obtained increasing attention in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, the graphs constructed by utilizing the geometrical structure similarity of samples are unreliable due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the HSIs, especially for the case of very limited labeled pixels. Our motivation is to construct label propagation ensemble (LPE) model, then use the decision fusion of multiple label propagations to obtain pseudolabeled pixels with high classification confidence. In LPE, random subspace method is introduced to partition the feature space into multiple subspaces, then several label propagation models are constructed on corresponding subspaces, finally the results of different label propagation models are fused at decision level, and only the unlabeled pixels whose label propagation results are the same will be assigned with pseudolabels. Meanwhile extreme learning machine classifiers are trained on the labeled and pseudolabeled samples during the iteration. Compared with traditional label propagation methods, our proposed method can deal with the situation of very limited labeled samples by providing pseudolabeled pixels with high classification confidence, consequently, the accurate base classifiers are obtained. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, LPE is compared with several state-of-the-art methods on four hyperspectral datasets. In addition, the method that only use label propagation is investigated to show the importance of ensemble technique in LPE.

For the daily protein intake of 1.0-1.5 g/body weight-1.-d1 required in patients with chronic dialysis treatment, dependent upon dialysis technique and nutritional state, this simultaneously means a dependence of the total quantity of food to be taken in upon body weight, which again has effects on the dialysis regime and the ultrafiltration, since a more or less intensive intake of water, potassium and phosphate is connected with this. The removal of catabolic conditions is a scarcely soluble problem above all in dialysis patients with high optimum weight, by which the often existing inappetence inhibits the necessary increased food intake. The is furthermore rendered difficult in the peritoneal dialysis with peritonitis, since the ultrafiltration is reduced by the inflammation so that the water taken in with food cannot be excreted in a necessary degree.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "year": 1988, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "3388919", "doi": null, "venue": "Zeitschrift fur die gesamte innere Medizin und ihre Grenzgebiete", "journal": "Zeitschrift fur die gesamte innere Medizin und ihre Grenzgebiete", "mag_id": "2420199842", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2870531"}

Patient safety training priorities for GPs at all career stages are described in the Royal College of General Practitioners' curriculum. Current methods that are taught and employed to improve safety often use a 'find-and-fix' approach to identify components of a system (including humans) where performance could be improved. However, the complex interactions and inter-dependence between components in healthcare systems mean that cause and effect are not always linked in a predictable manner. The Safety-II approach has been proposed as a new way to understand how safety is achieved in complex systems that may improve quality and safety initiatives and enhance GP and trainee curriculum coverage. Safety-II aims to maximise the number of events with a successful outcome by exploring everyday work. Work-as-done often differs from work-as-imagined in protocols and guidelines and various ways to achieve success, dependent on work conditions, may be possible. Traditional approaches to improve the quality and safety of care often aim to constrain variability but understanding and managing variability may be a more beneficial approach. The application of a Safety-II approach to incident investigation, quality improvement projects, prospective analysis of risk in systems and performance indicators may offer improved insight into system performance leading to more effective change. The way forward may be to combine the Safety-II approach with 'traditional' methods to enhance patient safety training, outcomes and curriculum coverage.", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "27800711", "doi": "10.1080/14739879.2016.1246068", "venue": "Education for primary care : an official publication of the Association of Course Organisers, National Association of GP Tutors, World Organisation of Family Doctors", "journal": "Education for primary care : an official publication of the Association of Course Organisers, National Association of GP Tutors, World Organisation of Family Doctors", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2548518306", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["79010550", "2597801", "148201090", "27024622", "43390910", "72710022", "20481250", "141593476", "32020835", "14848178", "11795302", "142829783", "107050553", "11916845", "19934375", "106767433", "3325292", "27730582", "16896386"], "inbound_citations": ["52955813", "80900661", "5352220", "85463517", "57758711", "215282409", "4731161", "3398010"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2870542"}

If not completely quenched, it can specifically trigger the up-regulation of the expression of genes which are involved in the molecular defence response of plants against photo-oxidative stress.", "year": 2004, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "15310815", "doi": "10.1093/jxb/erh237", "venue": "J Exp Bot", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2165747201", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["85090630", "84154852", "2014803", "132552", "21773686", "93731271", "9522914", "7976715", "94923871", "92347033", "31521054", "46157018", "23650997", "36433687", "99051804", "84436692", "11942248", "11990886", "28273807", "28824413", "19695835", "85070818", "21427119", "22967145", "43739306", "28839484", "89438943", "6942238", "1116041", "34827314", "11273514", "25490523", "37232201", "24621179", "43150908", "84860684", "25290495", "85966553", "86157979", "93173499", "1021720", "26249113", "43175847", "8789971", "94589903", "20600891", "95307128", "11035455", "4430910", "24399676", "85599764", "40673031", "195684279", "9156533", "25889371", "13301661", "34138752", "31544381", "38244368", "20301759", "24350171", "4344756"], "inbound_citations": ["2417095", "15122943", "204887000", "676918", "16398629", "2367735", "4042988", "55230130", "15442149", "32220278", "15348166", "22326224", "7952531", "10046893", "25552852", "22046139", "41460368", "34918997", "5043935", "23928070", "52835526", "35206135", "22305050", "24299259", "23536679", "7665224", "16986630", "15881551", "24164993", "2685721", "212642475", "3489237", "6982485", "13198502", "14897439", "7904124", "49728819", "2032102", "4480510", "214684102", "7706301", "2047499", "6400114", "491560", "7146390", "27428704", "23819302", "208583964", "12674066", "85464346", "36663109", "15697959", "22917039", "195698998", "13632707", "3694408", "6562274", "22099580", "215008161", "15498094", "174807625", "55180556", "13368210", "1275132", "205694373", "10562736", "33657524", "209516880", "21932941", "26310094", "23349166", "56448533", "18223786", "49559267", "14893637", "10127630", "5114825", "6858939", "90999783", "25892315", "10263928", "3758531", "2354177", "53260169", "19278306", "10761652", "52035201", "2200053", "207199311", "14250457", "11784998", "85528272", "15966175", "14419543", "8007235", "5783497", "23390268", "199464248", "7810377", "19109763", "2728164", "17666040", "40395601", "17200631", "9082564", "10108583", "9829277", "20849749", "12808575", "41179051", "210039515", "13145364", "8705297", "24929716", "16111369", "202160281", "92409138", "25142752", "202236641", "215626134", "21633968", "17201438", "2834223", "3546771", "215438997", "88165152", "23937184", "214821010", "7707206", "46279765", "84053904", "14109468", "214905682", "46806114", "52255759", "10860640", "10317782", "8162968", "173188179", "12360600", "7572268", "89086660", "9832108", "1488693", "10561423", "9584040", "12957579", "5154996", "14136482", "23819672", "30022384", "31889470", "91615772", "198985239", "38791414", "54168551", "7773017", "18982209", "59944394", "25678577", "8870000", "43341160", "214932428", "27443988", "14697188", "2810771", "53407948", "4155856", "5019840", "2880514", "214847340", "2595545", "17046374", "8064175", "386510", "9927431", "14952910", "24140747", "6575349", "49351702"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2871295"}

This group of children presents problems to meet cognitive and behavioral levels expected in children of the same age and development (Romero-Ayuso, Maestu, Gonzalez-Marques, Romo-Barrientos & Andrade, 2006). Children diagnosed with ADHD present cognitive problems that make scholarly activities challenging. Because these children struggle identifying individual graphemes or constructing meaningful words they find it difficult to complete reading assignments. There are issues with their short time memory that contributes to their dyslexia or dysgraphia diagnosis (Pineda, 2009). Low average marks, failed grades, expulsions, dropout rates, and lower rate of undergraduate completion characterize the academic difficulties faced by children with ADHD (U.S. Department of Education, 2015). In addition, ADHD children present persistent symptoms related to inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity that make it difficult to be socially integrated. Sometimes they adopt a self-defense position and are not aware of their physical strength that sometimes causes that a peer ends hurt, and thereof ignored or rejected for their schoolmates. For these children, teachers have to implement different approaches when assigning activities aiming to gain a student's interest and encourage peer interactions. In that regard some efforts have been focused to using digital technologies as the medium to create a better accepted learning experience, in some cases, for instance, digital technology which has been seen as a resource that can help teachers to deliver course content in a social story way. KAPEAN similarly uses a technology-based setting to let the child play with educational resources. While playing children practices some of their memory, attention and reasoning skills. In addition, KAPEAN collects information about the affective states that are present during the educational game as it aims to get understanding of how to take into account children emotions for future designs of adaptive tutoring tools. In the following sections we first review the literature that indicates the interest for developing affection-based adaptive learning tools. Next we describe the methodology followed to design the case study. Then a discussion of results from playing with KAPEAN is presented. Finally, conclusions and the future work for KAPEAN are given. Literature review At the school setting children are expected to achieve tasks with minimal distraction in such a way that pupils can acquire information, complete assignments and participate in classrooms activities and discussions. This level of behavior is most of the time however unachievable for children with ADHD. These children exhibit behaviors that make it difficult to maintain interactions with teachers and with peers. For this group of children the American Psychiatric Association defines a combination of behaviors that can be grouped into poor sustained attention and hyperactivity-impulsiveness (Jackson, 2004). Furthermore, children with ADHD can present other behavioral problems or learning disabilities. The design of successful instructional strategies and practices require from the teacher a careful study of the child's needs such as how, when and why the child is inattentive, impulsive and hyperactive. In that regard we observed that some work proposed the integration of digital technologies such as computers and mobile devices as the medium to deliver instructional resources. The use of multimedia applications can offer different advantages from its physical resource counterpart, especially when considering that children are within a digital landscape. Many children today stay at home watching TV, listening to music, playing videogames, chatting or surfing the Web. Xu, Reid and Steckelberg (2002) offers a review of the extent to which technology could be seen as effective tools to support computer-assisted instruction, cognitive training, biofeedback training, assessment, and behavior modification, something children with ADHD can positively be affected with. \u2026", "year": 2016, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": "Educational Technology & Society", "journal": "Educational Technology & Society", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2578380364", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["28627625", "753606", "8909542", "14870991", "16453864", "146763190", "2567620", "15867951", "205566822", "1212510"], "inbound_citations": ["36887028"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2871533"}

Formation of palladium nanoparticles was investigated in aqueous medium via reduction by hydrazine, using PVP and the clay mineral hectorite as stabilizers. Effects of the polymer and concentration of silicate and palladium ions on the particle formation rate were analyzed.

However, considerable numbers of cancer cells, especially some highly malignant tumors, are resistant to apoptosis induction by TRAIL, and some cancer cells that were originally sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis can become resistant after repeated exposure (acquired resistance). Understanding the mechanisms underlying such resistance and developing strategies to overcome it are important for the successful use of TRAIL for cancer therapy. Resistance to TRAIL can occur at different points in the signaling pathways of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Dysfunctions of the death receptors DR4 and DR5 due to mutations can lead to resistance. The adaptor protein Fas-associated death domain (FADD) and caspase-8 are essential for assembly of the death-inducing signaling complex, and defects in either of these molecules can lead to TRAIL resistance. Overexpression of cellular FADD-like interleukin-1\u03b2-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (cFLIP) correlates with TRAIL resistance in several types of cancer. Overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL, loss of Bax or Bak function, high expression of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, and reduced release of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac/Diablo) from the mitochondria to the cytosol have all been reported to result in TRAIL resistance in mitochondria-dependent type II cancer cells. Finally, activation of different subunits of mitogen-activated protein kinases or nuclear factor-kappa B can lead to development of either TRAIL resistance or apoptosis in certain types of cancer

Moreover, since genes coding for Shiga toxins are located in genomes of lambdoid phages, understanding of mechanisms controlling \u03bb DNA replication may be of bio-medical importance. During lytic development of bacteriophage \u03bb, its genome is replicated according to the \u03b8 (circle-to-circle) mode early after infection, and then it is switched to the \u03c3 (rolling circle) mode. Two mechanisms of regulation of this switch were proposed recently and both suggested a crucial role for directionality of \u03bb DNA replication. Whereas one hypothesis assumed transient impairment of ClpP/ClpX-mediated proteolysis of the \u03bbO initiator protein, another suggested a crucial role for transcriptional activation of the ori\u03bb region and factors involved in the control of the p R promoter activity. Here we demonstrate that mutations in clpP and clpX genes had little influence on both directionality of \u03bb DNA replication and appearance of \u03c3 replication intermediates. On the other hand, regulators affecting activity of the p R promoter (responsible for initiation of transcription, which activates ori\u03bb) directly or indirectly influenced directionality of \u03bb DNA replication to various extents. Therefore, we conclude that regulation of the efficiency of transcriptional activation of ori\u03bb, rather than transient impairment of the \u03bbO proteolysis, is responsible for the control of the switch from \u03b8 to \u03c3 replication, and propose a model for this control.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00438-007-0228-y", "venue": "Molecular Genetics and Genomics", "journal": "Molecular Genetics and Genomics", "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "1987775429", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology"], "outbound_citations": ["42862721", "86557658", "42062280", "1100376", "27393874", "12194593", "25383052", "45916457", "84629016", "20572919", "1908419", "85112409", "43316929", "86024481", "11520870", "85658872", "34108824", "924345", "19772607", "41768577", "43847409", "81985220", "40652701", "22463853", "16097177", "37532148", "89487296", "38019067", "35188269", "13212850"], "inbound_citations": ["34020068"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2872418"}

The HOG pathway is rapidly activated under conditions of elevated osmolarity and regulates transcriptional and metabolic changes within the cell. Under normal growth conditions, however, a three-component phospho-relay consisting of the histidine kinase Sln1, the transfer protein Ypd1, and the response regulator Ssk1 represses HOG pathway activity by phosphorylation of Ssk1. This inhibition of the HOG pathway is essential for cellular fitness in normal osmolarity. Nevertheless, the extent to and mechanisms by which inhibition is robust to fluctuations in the concentrations of the phospho-relay components has received little attention.ResultsWe established that the Sln1-Ypd1-Ssk1 phospho-relay is robust\u2014it is able to maintain inhibition of the HOG pathway even after significant changes in the levels of its three components. We then developed a biochemically realistic mathematical model of the phospho-relay, which suggested that robustness is due to buffering by a large excess pool of Ypd1. We confirmed experimentally that depletion of the Ypd1 pool results in inappropriate activation of the HOG pathway.ConclusionsWe identified buffering by an intermediate component in excess as a novel mechanism through which a phospho-relay can achieve robustness. This buffering requires multiple components and is therefore unavailable to two-component systems, suggesting one important advantage of multi-component relays.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC4377207", "pubmed_id": "25888817", "doi": "10.1186/s12918-015-0158-y", "venue": "BMC Systems Biology", "journal": "BMC Systems Biology", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2113342589", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine", "Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": ["14184489", "196683849", "14580131", "1829908", "14778312", "7979573", "12596197", "1148836", "16748971", "29487287", "17906346", "20691740", "6214239", "33532179", "39411219", "38758367", "45858722", "29058803", "8139806", "36471021", "22276096", "6790598", "25553932", "4344864", "206745809", "22428321", "12350938", "27150978", "12600062", "8208303", "197562", "39978504", "32995250", "526779", "14965629", "9565525", "12256067", "13131970"], "inbound_citations": ["215154863", "15565250", "38404525"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2872653"}

Channel estimation is one of the key challenges in an OFDM system. In this paper, we formulate OFDM channel estimation as a compressive sensing problem, which takes advantage of the sparsity of the channel impulse response and reduces the number of probing measurements, which in turn reduces the ADC speed needed for channel estimation. Specifically, we propose sending out pilots with random phases in order to ``spread out\" the sparse taps in the impulse response over the uniformly downsampled measurements at the low speed receiver ADC, so that the impulse response can still be recovered by sparse optimization. This contribution leads to high resolution channel estimation with low speed ADCs, distinguishing this paper from the existing attempts of OFDM channel estimation. We also propose a novel estimator that performs better than the commonly used $\\ell_1$ minimization. Specifically, it significantly reduces estimation error by combing $\\ell_1$ minimization with iterative support detection and limited-support least-squares. While letting the receiver ADC running at a speed as low as $1/16$ of the speed of the transmitter DAC, we simulated various numbers of multipaths and different measurement SNRs.

Tablet tensile strength (TS) and disintegration time (DT) were measured before and after storage for 30 days at 40 \u00b0C and 75% relative humidity. An ensemble artificial neural network (EANN) was used to predict responses to differences in quantities of excipients and physical-chemical properties of active ingredients in tablets. Most classical neural networks involve a tedious trial and error approach, but EANNs automatically determine basal key parameters, which ensure that an optimal structure is rapidly obtained. We compared the predictive abilities of EANNs in which the following kinds of training algorithms were used: linear, radial basis function, general regression (GR), and multilayer perceptron. The GR EANN predicted pharmaceutical responses such as TS and DT most accurately, as evidenced by high correlation coefficients in a leave-some-out cross-validation procedure. When used in conjunction with a tablet database, the GR EANN is capable of identifying acceptable candidate tablet formulations. \u00a9 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 99:42014214, 2010", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "20310024", "doi": "10.1002/jps.22135", "venue": "Journal of pharmaceutical sciences", "journal": "Journal of pharmaceutical sciences", "mag_id": "2092378439", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["2751384", "6907289", "102028871", "215091348", "1379407"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2874147"}

When faced with the family-sized box of breakfast cereal, five sizes of french fries, or a 14-in dinner plate, it is easy to forget our world history. In 75 years we have gone from shivering in Depression breadlines and hoarding food-ration stamps to being an overweight, super-sized country. Most of us are now surrounded with a portion-distorted embarrassment of food (1). We find portion distortions in supermarkets, where the number of larger sizes has increased 10-fold between 1970 and 2000 (2). We find portion distortions in restaurants, where the jumbo-sized portions are consistently 250% larger than the regular portion. We even find portion distortions in our homes (3), where the sizes of our bowls and glasses have steadily increased and where the surface area of the average dinner plate has increased 36% since 1960 (4). And if our bowls, glasses, and plates do not distort us, our recipes will. In the 2006 edition of the Joy of Cooking, the serving size of some entrees has increased by as much as 62% from some recipes in the first edition of 1920.

Topical application of agents that induce differentiation could selectively inhibit tumor cell growth, inducing a program of cell death with the production of cross-linked protein envelopes as the terminal event of this process at the skin surface, effectively eliminating the neoplastic phenotype. The nonspecific kinase inhibitor staurosporine induces cornified envelope assembly in neoplastic keratinocytes and causes tumor regression (A. A. Dlugosz and S. H. Yuspa, Cancer Res., 51: 4677-4684, 1991). In pursuit of less toxic agents, specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors were tested for the ability to induce differentiation in keratinocyte-derived cells. Of a range of inhibitors tested, only MC was able to induce cross-linked protein and consequent cell death in mouse and human primary normal keratinocytes, 308 neoplastic mouse keratinocytes, HPV-18-infected immortalized human keratinocytes, and human lines SQCC-Y1 (squamous carcinoma) and A431 (epidermoid carcinoma). MC increased cross-linked protein in a dose-dependent manner (0.05-1 mM). To confirm differentiation, MC-treated mouse primary normal keratinocytes were tested for activation of the endogenous cross-linking enzyme transglutaminase, but no association was found between transglutaminase activity and MC-induced protein cross-linking. MC also induced protein cross-linking in the fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 and in B16 melanoma cells, in which cornified envelope assembly is not part of the differentiation process. This cross-linking occurred at 4 degrees C, suggesting a nonphysiological process. Western blot analysis of an in vitro assay with purified EGF receptor showed that MC was able to cross-link the receptor. As in NIH3T3 cells, DTT inhibited cross-linking, suggesting that oxidation of MC or an acceptor group may be required for this effect. Thus, MC does not induce differentiation by a physiological mechanism in epithelial cells but causes chemical protein cross-linking into cornified envelope-like structures at high concentration.", "year": 1995, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "7585535", "doi": null, "venue": "Cancer research", "journal": "Cancer research", "mag_id": "2107689752", "mag_field_of_study": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["89295118", "28999945", "25763220"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2874584"}

The Laplacian pyramid is a multi-resolution image representation that captures the loss of information occuring through repeated reduction of the spatial resolution. The generation of this data structure involves the use of two complementary functions: EXPAND, which increases the size of an image by a factor of 2, and REDUCE, which performs the reverse operation. The first modification is the adjunction of a pre-filter to the initial EXPAND function in order to guarantee an image extrapolation that is an exact interpolation of the coarser resolution level. The second refinement is a REDUCE operation modified to minimize information loss. The corresponding least squares Laplacian pyramid (LSLP) is generated by adding a post-filter to the initial REDUCE function. These new functions have an efficient implementation using recursive algorithms. Preliminary experiments indicate improved performance: for a Gaussian-like kernel ( a= 3 8 ), the new EXPAND function exhibits a 2 to 2.5 dB attenuation of the first level of the Laplacian pyramid, while the complete scheme (LSLP)_leads to a 4.7 to 8.5 dB improvement in the two images used to test the procedure. For comparable compression ratios, the subjective image quality for the LSLP appears to be significantly better. A theoretical relationship between the present approach and the family of quadrature mirror filter image pyramids is also derived.", "year": 1991, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/0165-1684(92)90007-J", "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1967447459", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": ["7863995", "54119578", "10177743", "116098693", "2150419", "10960406", "14073725", "62676622", "630502", "121586358", "42151621", "120839836", "18421232", "119958680"], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2875387"}

While PC7 has no known specific substrates, it shows redundancy with other PCs. A genome-wide association study suggested that circulating levels of shed human transferrin receptor 1 (hTfR1) are regulated by PC7. We thus examined whether hTfR1 constitutes a specific substrate for PC7. Coexpression of hTfR1 with PCs in several cell lines indicated that PC7 is the only convertase that sheds this receptor into the medium. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that cleavage occurs at the unusual site KTECER100 \u2193LA, in which the P1 Arg100 and P6 Lys95 are critical. Pharmacological treatments revealed that shedding of hTfR1 by PC7 requires endocytosis into acidic clathrin-coated vesicles. A PC7 chimera, in which the transmembrane domain and the cytosolic tail of PC7 were replaced by that of the convertase furin, lost its ability to cleave the receptor, demonstrating the importance of these domains in the regulation of PC7 function. Analysis of primary hepatocytes from mice lacking furin, PC5, PACE4, or PC7 revealed that hepcidin, which limits iron availability in the circulation, is specifically generated by furin and not by PC7. Finally, depletion of iron in the medium of hepatoma cell lines incubated with the iron chelator desferrioxamine resulted in PC7 down-regulation. ::: ::: ::: CONCLUSION ::: Among the PC family members, only furin activates hepcidin in hepatocytes, and uniquely the full-length membrane-bound PC7 can directly shed hTfR1 by cleavage at Arg100 \u2193. Our results support the notion that, when iron is limiting, hTfR1 levels increase at least in part by way of the down-regulation of PC7 expression.

Linkers of 11 residues or more were required for biological activity. Equilibrium stability varied substantially with linker length, reaching a maximum for glycine-rich linkers containing 19 residues. The effects of linker length on equilibrium stability arise from significant and sometimes opposing changes in folding and unfolding kinetics. By fixing the linker length at 19 residues and varying the ratio of Ala/Gly or Ser/Gly in a 16-residue-randomized region, the effects of linker flexibility were examined. In these libraries, composition rather than sequence appears to determine stability. Maximum stability in the Ala/Gly library was observed for a protein containing 11 alanines and five glycines in the randomized region of the linker. In the Ser/Gly library, the most stable protein had seven serines and nine glycines in this region. Analysis of folding and unfolding rates suggests that alanine acts largely by accelerating folding, whereas serine acts predominantly to slow unfolding. These results demonstrate an important role for linker design in determining the stability and folding kinetics of single-chain proteins and suggest strategies for optimizing these parameters.", "year": 1998, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": "PMC34497", "pubmed_id": "9600894", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.95.11.5929", "venue": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "2142402729", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["15295145", "2275949", "44210016", "2386903", "20938318", "8203711", "6997563", "215065526", "215434129", "6536557", "16758658", "16859265", "84717", "1412794", "53730620", "13307876", "25260838", "7450471", "40984076", "16924925", "5201494", "11160765", "215566299", "14014714", "7455740", "12664059", "1126554", "1195945", "12059272", "14545993", "18457994", "4783454", "25722816", "82376743", "52998860", "3642048", "17765314", "11258585", "11145362", "46535349", "3538728", "25634959", "7318291", "21241530", "44098047", "1329989", "1588203", "92462586", "41076131", "13377036", "5254235", "11981165", "29245554", "208146213", "11284020", "20254342", "1241339", "20813151", "19644531", "18394552", "16775854", "28197944", "3862007", "17726097", "35533094", "13256563", "15205009", "2091327", "202014700", "16435811", "15226353", "203625720", "14058141", "215417536", "45815996", "8623769", "11710032", "85938636", "8316940", "49325878", "18685052", "210072244", "8618342", "2222163"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2877363"}

However, regression is not informative enough if the conditional density is multimodal, heteroskedastic, and asymmetric. In such a case, estimating the conditional density itself is preferable, but conditional density estimation (CDE) is challenging in high-dimensional space. A naive approach to coping with high dimensionality is to first perform dimensionality reduction (DR) and then execute CDE. However, a two-step process does not perform well in practice because the error incurred in the first DR step can be magnified in the second CDE step. In this letter, we propose a novel single-shot procedure that performs CDE and DR simultaneously in an integrated way. Our key idea is to formulate DR as the problem of minimizing a squared-loss variant of conditional entropy, and this is solved using CDE. Thus, an additional CDE step is not needed after DR.

Here, we investigate one possible approach to this integration, which capitalizes on using a micro-game that can be played with a teacher's guidance as a supplement after a traditional expository lecture followed by a debriefing. The game's purpose is to reinforce and integrate part of the knowledge learnt during the lecture. We investigated feasibility of this approach in a quasi-experimental study in 70 min long seminars on the topic of animal learning at 5 classes at 4 different high-schools in the Czech Republic. Each class was divided to two groups randomly. After an expository lecture, the game group played a game called Orbis Pictus Bestialis while the control group received an extra lecture that used media-rich materials. The time allotment was the same in both groups. We investigated the immediate and one month delayed effects of the game on students' knowledge reinforced and integrated by the game as well as on knowledge learnt during the expository lecture but not strengthened by the game. We also investigated students' overall appeal towards the seminar and its perceived educational value. Data from 100 students were analysed. The results showed that a) the game-playing is comparable to the traditional form of teaching concerning immediate knowledge gains and has a significant medium positive effect size regarding retention, b) the game-playing is not detrimental to information transmitted in the expository lecture but not strengthened by the game, c) perceived educational value and the overall appeal were high in the game group, nevertheless the perceived educational value was slightly lower in the game group comparing to the traditional group.

This calculation was based on two vital assumptions: (1) full avoidance of somal contact is achieved when the imaginary central axis is fully covered by the projections of the dorsal setae on this axis; and (2) investment per seta is proportional to setal length to the power 3 (which holds only when the seta is cone- shaped and the setal diameter-length ratio is constant). While the first assumption is a gross oversimplification, the second assumption lacks support by hard data. In this paper we will ( 1 ) extend the optimality model to include a more general class of diameter-length relations with respect to dorsal setae, (2) present measurements of diameter-length relations in various genera of the Phytoseiidae and (3) predict the optimal number of setae for comparison with the actual number of dorsal setae. This test of the model will then be used to determine wbether the number of dorsal setae in phytosciid mites can be considered as an adaptation or a phylo- genetic constraint. OPTIMAL INVESTMENT IN SETAE Suppose that ( I ) the central axis has length L, (2) each seta has !ength l and a hooked shape with e being the length of the part perpendicular to the soma and l - e being the length of the remaining part parallel to the soma, (3) the setae are standing in a longitudinal row, are equal in length and their projections on the central axis (l') do not overlap. Finally, suppose that (4) the per seta investment in terms of resources (r) is proportional to the volume of a cone with length I and diameter d and that (5) because d and l should pass through the origin, the functional relationship is of the \u00a9 Science and Technology Letters.

Comparatively, only a few behavioural and imaging studies have investigated how cognition of space and body may depend on vestibular processing. This study was designed to differentiate the influence of left versus right anodal GVS compared to sham stimulation on object-based versus egocentric mental transformations. While GVS was applied, subjects made left-right judgments about pictures of a plant or a human body presented at different orientations in the roll plane. All subjects reported illusory sensations of body self-motion and/or visual field motion during GVS. Response times in the mental transformation task were increased during right but not left anodal GVS for the more difficult stimuli and the larger angles of rotation. Post-hoc analyses suggested that the interfering effect of right anodal GVS was only present in subjects who reported having imagined turning themselves to solve the mental transformation task (egocentric transformation) as compared to those subjects having imagined turning the picture in space (object-based mental transformation). We suggest that this effect relies on shared functional and cortical mechanisms in the posterior parietal cortex associated with both right anodal GVS and mental imagery.", "year": 2007, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": "17717649", "doi": "10.1007/s00221-007-1095-9", "venue": "Experimental Brain Research", "journal": "Experimental Brain Research", "has_pdf_body_text": true, "mag_id": "1979692679", "mag_field_of_study": ["Psychology", "Medicine"], "outbound_citations": ["23940976", "12047198", "44694652", "27687210", "17677272", "12557925", "7975788", "42780537", "23603050", "8441435", "32077072", "7959793", "9734714", "17646707", "23825409", "42930572", "8369966", "2053973", "201925861", "9607853", "9552152", "41420424", "28657995", "142949831", "16499453", "31457753", "35717021", "72644813", "22786533", "44594265", "4479132", "23213978", "29929922", "16357397", "15313209", "21768192", "15366153", "6166886", "5640672", "1803126", "281280", "14057658", "42945064"], "inbound_citations": ["214877679", "1360775", "511958", "142479152", "207887828", "44163905", "36278574", "91943620", "2654429", "5823532", "14046710", "195259680", "195699073", "16870143", "23462035", "46952141", "2814706", "3909587", "3046001", "207580833", "5868607", "8287491", "213193444", "3157894", "12988916", "152208637", "14640408", "7719631", "16680286", "3238555", "15553952", "13706449", "14538856", "6062318", "9282075", "5071223", "55850080", "7320604", "10966609", "17847809", "12416811", "14292953", "2046353", "49645655", "62820781", "4633201", "11631053", "4299755", "23216075", "27597262"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": true, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": true, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": true, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:2879848"}

The Temporary Law implied a sharp turn in Swedish asylum legislation. The right to family reunification, which previously had been granted subsidiary protection beneficiaries and refugees on a similar basis, was suddenly heavily restricted for beneficiaries of subsidiary protection. The government claimed that the changes corresponded to the minimum requirements of EU-law and international law. The Temporary Law did however become an object of major criticism, and the critique primarily concerned the restrictions\u2019 potential conflict with rights under the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (the ECHR). ::: ::: This thesis examines if the Temporary Law restrictions on the right to family reunification for subsidiary protection beneficiaries were in compliance with the requirements under Articles 8 and 14 ECHR. The restrictions are hereby examined in relation to the right to respect for family life and the prohibition of discrimination. The analysis identifies a number of issues regarding the compatibility with Articles 8 and 14 ECHR. The particular vulnerability of subsidiary protection beneficiaries, which is linked to a presumed right to family reunification under Article 8 ECHR, was not recognised by the Temporary Law. Furthermore, the procedural obligations under Article 8 ECHR were arguably not fulfilled by the Temporary Law. The examination additionally concludes that the Temporary Law restrictions violated the prohibition of discrimination under Article 14 ECHR in conjunction with Article 8 ECHR. Considering that subsidiary protection beneficiaries and refugees are in a relevantly similar situation for the purpose of family reunification, the government failed to provide a reasonable and objective justification for the Temporary Law's differential treatment. ::: ::: In sum, this thesis suggests that the Temporary Law restrictions failed to meet the minimum level of protection under the ECHR. Accordingly, the Temporary Law not merely adjusted the right to family reunification down to the minimum of EU-law and international law, the Temporary Law fell below the minimum and hereby failed to comply with the obligations under Articles 8 and 14 ECHR. The failure to meet the minimum standards of the ECHR could be explained by the influential role of the immigration control prerogative in the context of human rights protection of immigrants.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "3008695211", "mag_field_of_study": ["Political Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213461867"}

Initially, we select 150 manufacturing companies but only 85 companies remain in the study sample after fulfilling the data availability criteria over a period from 2006-2017. The OLS regression model reveals that board independence has positive effects on both ROA and Tobin\u2019s Q, which supports some prior studies (Pearce& Zahra, 1991; Zahra & Pearce, 1989; EzzamelW Hossain, Prevost R Choi, Park Y Joh& Jung, 2012), but the relationship between board independence and Tobin\u2019s Q are not statistically significant. Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) has made it a mandatory requirement in the corporate governance guidelines to include1/5th of the total directors as independent directors into corporate boards for bringing transparency and accountability of its affairs without considering the underlying institutional differences. Though board independence is considered as an important mechanism of corporate board practices in most of the developed economies, it is still less appealing in emerging economies, especially in Bangladesh.

Methods: exploratory, experimental and quantitative study with two volunteers in two groups: Pilates (experimental group) and kinesiotherapy (control group). Assessment by Visual Analog Scale (VAS), goniometry, third finger ground test, perimeter and Lysholm scale. There were 12 consultations, twice a week, lasting 50 minutes. Results: Pilates pain was 3 at evaluation and 0 at reassessment, at kinesiotherapy it was 0 at both evaluation and reassessment. The knee flexion range of motion (ROM) in Pilates gained 12 degrees, in kinesiotherapy gained 17 degrees. Pilates flexibility was 13 cm in the evaluation and zeroed in the reevaluation, in kinesiotherapy it was 9 cm and 12 cm respectively. Pilates edema had no decrease in the operated limb perimeter, in kinesiotherapy there was a decrease. The knee function in Pilates has evolved from regular to good and in kinesiotherapy from good to excellent.

We reconstructed the economic model in the recently published Commercial lunar propellant architecture: a collaborative study of lunar propellant production (Kornuta et al., 2019) and used it to investigate the financial viability of providing propulsion as a service in GTOs. We used NASA\u2019s General Mission Analysis Tool to design a GTO service delivery flight plan, which we extend to cover sub and super synchronous delivery. We used economic, astrodynamic, and engineering models to derive the sensitivity of the internal rate of return to GTO launch costs, sale prices, tug inert mass fractions, and delivery orbit.

In 2017, especially in East Java, the harvest area is 2,278,460 hectares, and rice production is 13,633,701 tons. On the other hand, increasing agricultural activities can also contribute to emissions that can trigger climate change through the greenhouse gases (GHG) produced. GHG is a gas contained in the atmosphere, which absorbs and re-emits infrared radiation. Side effects of greenhouse gas accumulation can cause extreme climate change that affects land productivity. This study aims to analyze rice field productivity and build a greenhouse gas emission model that produce from the rice field productivity system. Emissions to be discussed in this study are CO2, CH4, and N2O. The approach is carried out with a system dynamics because it has the characteristics of a complex, non-linear system dynamics, changes in system behavior over time and feedback that describes new information about the state of the rice productivity system, which will then produce further decisions. The results of this study are causal loop diagram of CH4, CO2 and N2O emissions resulting from the productivity of rice fields modeled using system dynamics. This model contains GHG information generated from the agricultural sector and its impact. This model can be used as a consideration for the government and stakeholders as a reference for making policies for GHG emission mitigation technology as part of smart agriculture.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.procs.2019.11.204", "venue": null, "journal": "Procedia Computer Science", "mag_id": "2998313166", "mag_field_of_study": ["Computer Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213468212"}

A series of coring experiments on sandstone and granite using diamond impregnated and polycrystalline diamond compact bits are carried out on a specially designed vertical laboratory drilling rig. We present a comparison between the efficiency and quality of cores obtained using RED technology against conventional coring. Based on this analysis, improvements in penetration rates of up to 180% compared to conventional coring for the same drilling conditions were achieved. All cores retrieved are in good condition showing consistent diameters, generally smooth core surfaces and no evidence of fracturing or other visible core damage. Our preliminary assessment suggests that the RED coring technology provides significant improvements in Rate Of Penetration (ROP), while maintaining consistent core quality compared to conventional coring.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.petrol.2019.106866", "venue": null, "journal": "Journal of Petroleum Science and Engineering", "mag_id": "2997198047", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213468578"}

However, information on feelings and knowledge of young people and their teachers about livestock productions are scarce. Two surveys were conducted between March and July 2018 to collect such information\u2019s. A closed-questionnaire was full-filled by French secondary school pupils (SSP). SSP were selected because they will soon become adult consumers and citizens. A total of 1,087 SSP from 15 different high school located almost everywhere in France were inquired. Knowledge on livestock originated from media (89%), family or neighbourhood (57%), school (40%), web (40%) or social network, but is anyway very poor. Only 48% know that an ewe need to have a lamb to produce milk. They underline the very important role of livestock farming in providing food (96%), but question the conditions of production, and in particular their negative impact in terms of animal welfare (82%) and on the environment (61%). Only 4% declared to be vegetarian and 0.4% to be vegan, mostly girls. Simultaneously, 28 teachers of life sciences and geography from the same high school answered a semi directive investigation. Many of them (11/28) expressed difficulties in addressing these topics especially for life sciences teachers (10/15). They are indeed poorly informed themselves about livestock and agriculture (8/28), and may have difficulty answering questions from their students. Moreover, this subject is perceived as anecdotic in the training programs (19/28). Finally, they assume to propose a caricatured vision a livestock production proposed by school. The study highlights the necessity to give more information about livestock production to the future citizens and for this purpose to strength the educational resources available for the teachers.

Usually a number of images are acquired, with different time intervals to the time of injection. To facilitate for the patient and create the opportu- nity to treat more patients it is desirable to simplify the imaging process. At Skane University hospital (SUS) the number of imaging sessions has been reduced from four to one, acquired 96 hours p.i. Image acquisition is done with SPECT imaging, which is used for determination of absorbed dose. The main objective is a SPECT image of the kidneys, but there is also a great interest to map out the absorbed dose to tumours. In order to do so a two FOV SPECT image has to be acquired. Thus the total acquisition time becomes very long and patient movements has shown to be a great difficulty when matching the two FOV together. ::: ::: At SUS image acquisition is made with one energy window around the 208 keV photopeak and by adding a second one around the 113 keV photopeak, the acquisition time can hopefully be reduced. The determination of absorbed dose is based on a mean value of the activity concentration inside a VOI de- fined from CT image. Thus the task is to lower the acquisition time but still maintain a mean value with low uncertainty. This results in the question formulation: For SPECT imaging, of patients treated with 177Lu-DOTATATE, how much can the acquisition time be reduced when collecting information from 113 keV photopeak and 208 keV photopeak? ::: ::: Method: SPECT projection data of a cylindrical phantom, within it 6 spheres of different sizes, were simulated with Monte Carlo code SIMIND. Projection sets with activity in the spheres and activity in the background were simulated separately and added together in a later step. The reason for the separate simulation was to easily be able to modify the activity concentration in the spheres and background inde- pendent of each other. Different number of counts in the projection data can be a result of either different activity concentrations in source regions or due to different acquisition times. A quantity, named \u201ddis- integration concentration value\u201d, was defined as the number of radioactive decay during the acquisition time, per unit volume, to be able to change the acquisition time in the projection data. The disintegration concentration in the spheres was changed by multiplying with so called Disintegration Concentration value (DC-value) [MBq s/ml], derived from activity concentration multiplied with an acquisition time. Thus a higher DC-value is derived from a longer acquisition time, therefore the spheres obtained a higher disintegration concentration. A set of 10 projection sets were created, all multiplied with different DC- values, i.e. different time per projection. The projection data of the sphere and background were added together and four different contrasts of disintegration concentration, between the spheres and the back- ground, were evaluated for all 10 DC-values. For every projection set 50 noise realisation were created. Reconstruction was done with OS-EM algorithm, using 6 subsets and 40 iterations. Projection data for 113 keV and 208 keV were simulated separately and data from the reconstructed images were later added together. Masks of the spheres was created to extract data from the reconstructed images. The data were evaluated by the recovery of the activity concentration and CV, where the standard deviation, of the 50 mean values from the 50 noise realisations, was divided with both the measured disintegration concentration and the true disintegration concentration, respectively. ::: ::: Result & Conclusion: Image acquisition with two energy windows, one around the 113 keV photo- peak and one around 208 keV photopeak, results in time per projections according to DC-value=22.50 MBq s/ml. For tumours it indicates a time per projection of 22.5 seconds but for kidneys the time per projection would have to be 225 seconds, due to its lower activity concentration 96 hours p.i. compared to the activity concentration in tumours at that time. At SUS the time per projection is 45 seconds, meaning that for image acquisition of tumours the time per projection can be shortened by a factor 2. However for image acquisition of kidneys the time per projection needs to be prolonged by a factor 5 compared to today\u2019s image protocol.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": null, "mag_field_of_study": null, "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213341949"}

To illustrate, punishing abortion or allowing new productive technologies could be regarded as issues lying on the sovereignty of the state. Surrogate motherhood appears as one of the challenges of the 21th century due to these two concepts. As opposed to earlier times, the current more advanced stage of scientific, technological, communication and traveling possibilities plays an essential role. Furthermore, the legal perception of surrogacy in a global perspective lies on the grey area. In other words, whether it is legal or prohibited varies from country to country, which creates a legal loophole. Here is the way in which the advent of surrogate motherhood defies the state\u2019s sovereignty on its bio-politics and bio-power. Cross-border surrogate motherhood cases in law comes first at the legal recognition of the child by the country of the requesting people. As a matter of fact, its legal consequences appear firstly at civil law, inter alia, family law. Criminal law, with its subsidiary character, rises up by basing on the concepts, the definitions and the presumptions of civil law. Seeing these developments, to ensure individual human rights and prevent them from being victims or perpetrators of any crimes due to the cross border practiced surrogate motherhood cases, the question on where criminal law is supposed to stand rises, with which this study aims to explore. To be more precise, it mainly explores surrogacy as a possible criminal law issue. Additionally, the necessity on creating international legal documents in any form will be questioned.", "year": 2019, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2991608129", "mag_field_of_study": ["Political Science"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213344291"}

Assuming the validity of these projections and building on this likely scenario, this perspective article proposes oxygen-based coal conversion as a sustainable pathway for zero-carbon power generation, albeit not without its own challenges. The century-old tradition of burning coal in air is no longer sustainable. Achieving zero-carbon coal power dictates full capture of CO2 emissions. Unfortunately, renewable power is still far from fully displacing coal-based power despite major gains. Also, renewables are inherently non-dispatchable sources constrained severely by lack of utility-scale electricity storage. Moreover, prospects for total conversion of power generation to natural gas presents its own challenges due to uncertain impacts of hydraulic fracturing on the environment. It is highly likely that we will need both coal and natural gas for electricity production. Accordingly, this article proposes a roadmap that emphasizes rapid transitioning of coal-based (and natural gas-based) power generation from air-based combustion to oxygen-based conversion. The latter excludes nitrogen from entering the process stream and offers easy capture of CO2 to achieve zero-carbon electricity generation with significant savings on water demand.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.energy.2020.117074", "venue": null, "journal": "Energy", "mag_id": "3004603163", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213344970"}

In addition, there was a significant interaction between consonant voicing features and language group. A significant main effect for vowel tenseness was also found along with a significant interaction between vowel tenseness and language group.

It was confirmed that the addition of MgO has the effect of alleviating the decrease of the specific surface area during the repetitive regeneration procedure. The addition of MgO had no significant effect on the reducibility of the Ru/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst. The results of XRD, CO chemisorption and TEM imagery show that the addition of MgO to the Ru/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst has the effect of decreasing the mobility of Ru atoms during repetitive regeneration at 650 \u00b0C. It was confirmed that the degree of catalyst deactivation during four repetitive regeneration trials was much lower than that with an unpromoted catalyst, likely because the addition of MgO prevented the sintering of Ru at the regeneration temperature of 650 \u00b0C. The Ru-MgO/\u03b3-Al2O3 catalyst is a possible candidate as a reusable catalyst for use during the TCPD hydrogenation reaction.", "year": 2020, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cattod.2020.01.003", "venue": null, "journal": "Catalysis Today", "mag_id": "2999951128", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:213345445"}

NGF signaling induces faster outgrowth on LN through regulation of actomyosin restraint of microtubule advance into the growth cone periphery. It remains unclear whether growth cone turning on LN works through the same mechanism and, if it does, how the mechanism produces directed advance. Using a novel method for substrate patterning, we tested how directed advance occurs on LN by creating a gap immediately in front of a growth cone advancing on a narrow LN path. The growth cone stopped until an actin-rich protrusion extended over the gap, adhered to LN, and became stabilized. Stepwise advance over the gap was triggered by microtubule +tip entry up to the adhesion site of the protrusion and was independent of traction force pulling. We found that the probability of microtubule entry is regulated at the level of the individual protrusion and is sensitive to the rate of microtubule polymerization and the rate of rearward actin flow as controlled by adhesion-cytoskeletal coupling and MII. We conclude that growth cone navigation is an iterative process of variation and selection. Growth cones extend leading edge actin-rich protrusions that adhere transiently (variation). Microtubule entry up to an adhesion site stabilizes a protrusion (selection) leading to engorgement, consolidation, protrusive activity distal to the adhesion site, and stepwise growth cone advance.

From now on, it will be published online only as an open access journal. This brings substantial flexibility with, for example, increased opportunities to include colour images and figures. Manuscripts can now be submitted online, too. With regard to the type of papers published in ECOTROPICA, we will keep our \u201cclassical\u201d categories - Article, Short Communication and Review but will add new categories -\u201cField Station Profiles\u201d and occasional \u201cEssays\u201d. The former provides the opportunity to present well known and lesser known field stations to a broader audience. Essays are short papers that address topics and issues in tropical ecology not only from a strictly scientific viewpoint but taking a broader perspective. They will be published at the discretion of the editors. ECOTROPICA welcomes contributions to all fields of tropical ecology from fellow tropical ecologists from all over the world.

The intended target of his critique was above all democratic socialism and the dominant influence of the ideas of John Maynard Keynes. In 1951, the Dutch social democrat party (Partij van de Arbeid PvdA) published a plan of an ambition unequalled since: The Road to Freedom. It aimed at the liberation of man through socialism.

Universities that fulfill the criteria of establishing \u201cSport Sciences Faculty\u201d should initiate the necessary legal processes. Faculty members in the field should further involve in international venues and cooperate with scholars outside of Turkey in order to enhance their professional and academic capabilities.

New departments of sport sciences should be established if Turkey shows insufficiency in the field. Overall, some departments in the field of sport sciences encounter certain problems in terms of international recognition, fulfilling the needs of the field, and anxiety regarding their future.

Four girls whose language developed relatively favorably in spite of severe hearing losses of approximately 80dB or more were selected for this purpose. Language education was begun by their mothers who participated in our home training program when the girls were one year and five months old, one year and seven months old, one year and ten months old, and two years and four months old respectively. Data was collected through the use, by their mothers, of special diary to evaluate the psychos logical development and the development of language comprehension as well as verbal and nonverbal expressions, as observed in their deaf children. The results obtained are as follows:1. The development of language comprehension preceeded the growth of vocabulary in all cases.2. Pointing or inquisitive behavior emerged between the ages of two years and two years and eleven months.3. As soon as pointing behavior emerged, vocabulary began to increase rapidly, and infantile words, which previously held only generalized meanings, began to differentiate into individual words with specific meanings.4. At this time, most mothers commented that their child had found \u201cAll things have their own names.\u201dAs far as these four cases are concerned, the findings mentioned above suggest the conclusion that there is a critical period for language development in young children with severe hearing impairment.

Phase I: Qualitative research using ethnographic methods, to produce an empirical construct of \u2018kebersyukuran\u2019 in the Acehnese local communities\u2019 point of view. Later the construct would be used to produce a \u2018syukur\u2019 scale and training module. Phase II: Creating intervention program plan and building the team. Phase III : Training. Phase IV: Post-test, evaluation, and monitoring. The target of this intervention is the residents in four villages in Meuraksa and Jaya Baru, Banda Aceh.

Several observers noticed a spectral peak near the Brunt-Vaisala frequency. This peak often is characterized by a very steep slope at the high frequency part, but a fairly shallow slope towards lower frequencies. Some example spectra of stratosphere observations are given. This distinct spectral shape (most clear at the upper height 22.5 km) can be explained by the fact that the vertical velocity amplitudes of atmospheric gravity waves increase with frequency up to their natural cutoff at the Brunt-Vaisala frequency. The measurement of the frequency of the peak in a vertical velocity spectrum was found to yield most directly the Brunt-Vaisala-frequency profile. Knowing the Brunt-Vaisala frequency profile, one can deduce the potential temperature profile, if one has a calibration temperature at one height. However, even the uncalibrated profile will be quite useful, e.g., to determine fronts (defined by temperature inversions) and the tropopause height. This method fails for superadiabatic lapse rates when the Brunt-Viasala frequency is imaginary. The application of this method will also be difficult when the wind velocity is too high, causing the Doppler effect to smear out the total spectrum and blur the Brunt-Vaisala cutoff.

The Helmholtz theorem is proved in this letter to hold for arbitrary vector field, both static and time-dependent. Therefore, the conclusions of the paper [2] questioned in [1] are true. The validity of Helmholtz's theorem in the general case is due to the fact that the decomposition above of vector field does not influence the field time coordinate, which plays, thus, a passive role in the decomposition procedure.

Therefore, this study was conducted with aim to assess the appropriate cut-off point in glucose challenge test in pregnant women. Methods: In this study, data of Iranian pregnant women without diabetes referring to Rafsanjan gynecology clinics for assessment of gestational diabetes were collected. GCT was performed for the women in 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test was performed for women who their test result was \u00e2\ufffd\u00a5135 mg/dl and \u00e2\ufffd\u00a4200 mg/dl. The OGTT results were interpreted by Carpenter and Coustan criteria. Finally, the appropriate cut-off point of GCT was calculated by SPSS software (version 22) and the ROC curve. Results: The results of GCT showed that the maximum and minimum values of GCT were 93 and 199 mg/dl respectively, with mean\u00c2\u00b1SD of 161.99\u00c2\u00b115.83 mg/dl. 235 cases of pregnant women had positive GTT test. According to the ROC curves for all study population, GTT cut-off point was 140 mg/dl with 97 sensitivity, in low-risk group for gestational diabetes was 147 mg/dl with 96 sensitivity and for high risk group was 135 mg/dl with 100 sensitivity and had the most predictive value. Conclusion: Suitable cut-off point in GCT for gestational diabetes is different in low and high risk pregnant women. Depending on the presence or absence of risk factors in mothers, we can reduce or increase the cut-off point of the GCT.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2944525001", "mag_field_of_study": ["Medicine"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:164941398"}

In this lively survey, Guy D. Middleton critically examines our ideas about collapse - how we explain it and how we have constructed potentially misleading myths around collapses - showing how and why collapse of societies was a much more complex phenomenon than is often admitted. Rather than positing a single explanatory model of collapse - economic, social, or environmental - Middleton gives full consideration to the overlooked resilience in communities of ancient peoples and the choices that they made. He offers a fresh interpretation of collapse that will be accessible to both students and scholars. The book is an engaging, introductory-level survey of collapse in the archaeology/history literature, which will be ideal for use in courses on the collapse of civilizations, sustainability, and climate change. It includes up-to-date case studies of famous and less well-known examples of collapses, and is illustrated with 25 black and white illustrations, 3 line drawings, 16 tables and 18 maps.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "2729805997", "mag_field_of_study": ["History"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["4408210", "215292765", "200059176", "214629887", "211137609", "134039335", "133816841", "53047537"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:164943220"}

However, most research focuses on docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6 n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5 n-3). Few studies concern docosapentaenoic acid n-3 (DPA n-3, C22:5 n-3), which is not commercially available in sufficient amount for in vivo studies. This fatty acid is an intermediate between EPA and DHA in the n-3 PUFA conversion pathway from \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA, C18:3 n-3). It could be of interest both for DPA ability to be converted to EPA or DHA, mostly in the liver; and for its potential specific physiological effects. To our knowledge, no studies have been able to observe globally the specific enrichment of this fatty acid in the tissues when it was supplemented in vivo. ::: The objective of this study is therefore to examine the effect of DPA supplementation at a physiological dose on the PUFA composition of the main tissues in rats in order to guide future studies towards the search for physiological effects. ::: Methods ::: DPA was purified by preparative liquid chromatography. Two groups of Sprague Dawley male rats (n= 8 / group) were fed for 3 weeks from weaning with a 10% weight lipid diet supplemented or not with 0.5% DPA of total fatty acids (TFA) and containing ALA (2.3% of TFA, ratio n-6/n-3= 5). The TFA composition of 20 tissues was investigated by gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer. The two groups were compared by Student's t-test (p< 0.05). ::: Results ::: When supplemented, the proportion of DPA is significantly increased in the heart (x2.1), lung (x1.8), spleen (x1.6), bone marrow (x1.5) and kidney (X1.3). Its proportion tends to increase in the red blood cells (x1.4) and the pancreas (x1.2) but remains stable in the liver, plasma, brain and retina that are known to be impacted with diets supplemented with EPA or with DHA. ::: DHA status was significantly increased in the spleen (x1.2), lung (x1.2) and tends to increase in the bone marrow (x1.6). DPA supplementation would therefore increase the conversion to DHA. ::: The proportions of EPA were significantly increased in the liver (x2.0), plasma (x2.0), spleen (x1.5), lung (x1.3) and bone marrow (x1.1). This would confirm direct or indirect retroconversion through DHA from DPA to EPA. ::: Concerning the n-6 series PUFAs in competition with the enzymes of the n-3 conversion pathway, the proportions of DPA n-6 (C22:5 n-6) and arachidonic acid (C20:4 n- 6) decreased in some tissues specifically (red blood cells, heart, kidney, spleen, lung). ::: Conclusion ::: DPA supplementation at 0.5% of TFA results in enrichment of n-3 PUFA and depletion of n-6 PUFAs targeted in some tissues. This suggests a potential and specific action of this fatty acid. Future studies are now scheduled to determine the potential physiological effects of DPA in these organs as compared to DHA and EPA.", "year": 2017, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "2944720250", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": false, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:164948735"}

Leslie Fraser Standish Hore, known as George, one of the few surviving officers of the 8th Light Horse Regiment, whose Gallipoli experience culminated in the disaster of the attack at The Nek on 7 August, left a memorable record of that experience in three forms: firstly, in a series of observant coloured sketches; secondly in a letter to his wife which gave an account of the harrowing event; and thirdly and perhaps most significantly, he produced what he called the 'Anzac Panorama'. Informed by his pictures and by six smaller panoramas he had sketched during the campaign, it was completed from memory after the Gallipoli campaign was over. Hore then had it printed in Cairo, probably early in 1916. The panorama gives an interesting representation of Australian positions on 7 August, the day of the assault on Turkish positions at The Nek by the 8th and 10th Australian Light Horse Regiments. This article outlines Hore's background, and goes on to discuss all three aspects of his Gallipoli experience: his sketches, his account of the attack, in which he was wounded, and finally the 'Anzac Panorama', which brought together all that had gone before.

New ideas for precision tests of Gaussianity and statistical isotropy in the data are developing simultaneously with proposals for a wide range of new theoretical possibilities. From both the observations and theory, it has become clear that there is a huge discovery potential from upcoming measurements. The twin principles of statistical isotropy and homogeneity are a crucial ingredient in obtaining most important results in modern cosmology. For example, with these assumptions temperature and density fluctuations in different directions on the sky can be averaged out, leading to accurate constraints on cosmological parameters that we have today. Nevertheless, there is no fundamental reason why these must be obeyed by our universe. Statistical isotropy and homogeneity are starting to be sharply tested using the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. Recently, there has been particular activity in these areas, given Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe\u2019s remarkable maps, combined with claims of large-angle \u2019anomalies\u2019 indicating departures from statistical isotropy as predicted by standard inflationary models. The statement that primordial curvature fluctuations are nearly Gaussian on scales measured by the CMB is remarkably precise, but doesn\u2019t reveal much about their source. Current constraints on the amplitude of the three-point correlation function of fluctuations are nearly four orders of magnitude above predictions from single field slow-roll inflation models and at least an order of magnitude above what is expected just from non-linearities that develop after the primordial spectrum is laid down. There is a wide spectrum of interesting models that can be ruled out by tightening this constraint; conversely, a detection of non-Gaussianity would rule out single field slow-roll inflation. While current observations of the CMB fluctuations provide reasonably strong evidence for a primordial source of fluctuations from inflaton, only measurements of higher order statistics can truly shed light on the physics of inflation. Departures from statistical isotropy and Gaussianity involve a rich set of observable quantities, with diverse signatures that can be measured in the CMB or in large-scale structure using sophisticated statistical methods.

In agreement with results derived by previous authors, we explicitly show that at all points in the empty region between the slabs, including their surfaces, the electromagnetic fields always satisfy free-field canonical equal-time commutation relations. This result is a consequence of general analyticity and detailed fall-off properties at large frequencies satisfied by the reflection coefficients of all real materials.

Interestingly for small spin orbit coupling this is the largest contribution to the total polarization, its magnitude being of second order in the coupling constant. As a consequence this phenomenon cannot be revealed in lowest order perturbative approaches. An in plane spin polarization component is also present that is perpendicular to the current. Within the same model this component would be also present in the bulk.

Observational searches for this emission so far give no conclusive evidence but a few candidates at gamma rays. In this work we aim at developing a more sophisticated model for the non-thermal emission from massive runaway star bow shocks. The main goal is to establish whether these systems are efficient non-thermal emitters, even if they are not strong enough to be yet detected. For modeling the collision between the stellar wind and the interstellar medium we use 2D hydrodynamic simulations. We then adopt the flow profile of the wind and the ambient medium obtained with the simulation as the plasma state for solving the transport of energetic particles injected in the system, and the non-thermal emission they produce. For this purpose we solve a 3D (2 spatial + energy) advection-diffusion equation in the test-particle approximation. We find that a massive runaway star with a powerful wind converts 0.16-0.4% of the power injected in electrons into non-thermal emission, mostly produced by inverse Compton scattering of dust-emitted photons by relativistic electrons, and secondly by synchrotron radiation. This represents a fraction of $\\sim$ $10^{-5}-10^{-4}$ of the wind kinetic power.

Known today as Cosmic Microwave background (CMB), this diffuse radiation is commonly interpreted as a fossil light released in an early hot and dense universe and constitutes today the main 'pilar' of the big bang cosmology. Considerable efforts have been devoted to derive fundamental cosmological parameters from the characteristics of this radiation that led to a surprising universe that is shaped by at least three major unknown components: inflation, dark matter and dark energy. This is an important weakness of the present consensus cosmological model that justifies raising several questions on the CMB interpretation. Can we consider its cosmological nature as undisputable? Do other possible interpretations exist in the context of other cosmological theories or simply as a result of other physical mechanisms that could account for it? In an effort to questioning the validity of scientific hypotheses and the under-determination of theories compared to observations, we examine here the difficulties that still exist on the interpretation of this diffuse radiation and explore other proposed tracks to explain its origin.

We suggest testing the correlation by studying the deviation of SKS and S\ufffd'KS from the standard model predictions along with the constraints fromMBS and b! s in a realistic SO(10) model with lopsided flavor structure. We find a specific correlation between SKS and S\ufffd'KS that is intrinsic to the lopsided structure and discuss how to confirm or rule out this flavor pattern by the more accurate measurements of these CP violation quantities in B decay. The standard model (SM), although has passed many precision experimental tests, still has a number of out- standing problems which beg for a more fundamental the- ory. In terms of phenomenology, there are many places to test the more fundamental theory and, quite often, it is not one piece of phenomenology but a specific pattern of many pieces of phenomenology that fulfils this job. Neutrino oscillation clearly indicates the beyond SM physics in that it violates the accidental symmetry Le,\u00b5,\ufffd of SM lepton flavor. Moreover, the tiny neutrino masses can be most naturally explained by the seesaw mech- anism (1), indicating the Majorana nature of neutrinos that leads to violation of another accidental symmetry B \u2212 L of SM at a very high scale close to the grand unification theory (GUT) scale. For this reason, study- ing neutrino oscillation in the GUT framework becomes particularly interesting. In SO(10) GUT, quarks and leptons are unified into a single 16 multiplet, yet experimental data shows that the 2-3 (generation) mixing is dramatically different in the quark and lepton sectors.

These rules are applicable to a wide range of transfer functions: rational, fractional and non-rational ones in general, those with time-delays incorporated at various locations, as well as transfer functions describing distributed-parameter systems. An original, straightforward numerical procedure for plotting the root locus has been proposed next. By means of the derived techniques, a generalization of the pole-placement method, which is applicable to control design of both rational and non-rational processes has been proposed also. Finally, it has been shown that RL technique can be very effectively used to investigate the influence of open loop dead-time variations to closed loop poles. It is of particular interest to stress that the techniques proposed and analyzed in this work are exact, in the sense that no rational approximations of infinite-dimensional systems have been utilized.

The paper thus identifies instances of control in German finite verb-final and V2 complements and in nominalized clausal arguments, thereby adding data to the discussion of finite control. The lexical property of inherent control results from various factors: one major factor is event coherence -the respective predicates and their clausal complements denote a coherent event, which disallows incompatible local and temporal modifiers in matrix clause and embedded clause (e.g. with implicative verbs such as wagen 'dare'). As a consequence, matrix predicate and embedded predicate have to share at least one participant. In addition, there are various subgroups of inherent control predicates that do not exhibit event coherence. Here, the inherence of the control relation results a) from the sincerity conditions of the matrix predicates (with directive and commissive predicates), b) the fact that the clausal argument is integrated as \"direct predication\" of the matrix predicate's internal argument (e.g. vorwerfen 'reproach'), or c) semantic specialization of the matrix predicate in contrast to semantically similar predicates, which involves self-related attitudes or speech acts (e.g. bereuen 'regret/repent').", "year": 2010, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": null, "venue": null, "journal": null, "mag_id": "192720178", "mag_field_of_study": ["Mathematics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["84838627", "92996067"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:118867660"}

Current implementations of quantum cryptography are based on the BB84 protocol, which is susceptible to siphoning attacks on the multiple photons emitted by practical laser sources. This makes BB84-based quantum cryptography protocol unsuitable for network computing environments. Diffie-Hellman does not require the two parties to be mutually authenticated to each other, yet it can provide a basis for a number of authenticated protocols, most notably the concept of perfect forward secrecy. The work proposed in this paper provides a new direction in utilizing quantum EPR pairs in quantum key exchange. Although, classical cryptography boasts of efficient and robust protocols like the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, in the current times, with the advent of quantum computing they are very much vulnerable to eavesdropping and cryptanalytic attacks. Using quantum cryptographic principles, however, these classical encryption algorithms show more promise and a more robust and secure structure for applications. The unique properties of quantum EPR pairs also, on the other hand, go a long way in removing attacks like eavesdropping by their inherent nature of one particle of the pair losing its state if a measurement occurs on the other. The concept of perfect forward secrecy is revisited in this paper to attribute tighter security to the proposed protocol.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.2176775", "venue": "Commercial + Scientific Sensing and Imaging", "journal": null, "has_pdf_body_text": false, "mag_id": "267879618", "mag_field_of_study": ["Engineering", "Physics"], "outbound_citations": ["118520639", "30953293", "7356608", "14890191", "40014368", "124342155", "11839894"], "inbound_citations": ["20209445", "58311997"], "has_outbound_citations": true, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": true, "has_pdf_parsed_abstract": false, "has_pdf_parsed_body_text": false, "has_pdf_parsed_bib_entries": true, "has_pdf_parsed_ref_entries": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:118867819"}

We review the ::: published estimates of the global production rates of 14C due to galactic and solar cosmic ray particles, and present new estimates of the expected secular variations in 14C production, taking into account the latest information available on galactic ::: cosmic ray modulation and long-term variations in solar activity.

It is concluded that the observed higher frequency wiggles in atmospheric 14C/12C ratios occurring with time scales of about two hundred years and of 1 to 2 percent in magnitude (de Vries, 1958; Suess, 1970a,b; 1979; Damon, Lerman, and Long, 1978), are largely due to solar activity dependent modulation of the galactic cosmic ray flux by solar plasma.

The high ::: frequency modulation effect in 14C production is substantial, about 20 percent, which, considering the response function of the atmosphere (cf Houtermans, Suess, and ::: Oeschger, 1973), is adequate to explain the observed 14C wiggles (also named Suess wiggles or de Vries oscillations) if in the past, periods of large modulation effects and also periods of weak modulation persisted, ie, the sun remained both active and inactive over long periods of time, of the order of several decades to centuries. The ::: pioneering investigations of Eddy (1976; 1977) of the ancient records of solar activity make it plausible that the 14C wiggles in the ancient 14C/12C ratios are primarily due to modulation of galactic cosmic ray flux by a varying sun.

Similarities to and differences from other genera in the lactic acid bacteria are described. Lactobacilli use many different transport systems to obtain nutrients. Carbohydrates and organic acids are transported in cells by specific phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferases (PEP\u2014PTS) or permeases. The carbohydrates are then metabolized to different end products through a common key intermediate, pyruvate. The ability of lactobacilli to produce various end products depends on species, strains, genetic capacity, expression of enzyme activity, sugar structure, and environmental conditions.

The activities of tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC), strictosidine synthase (SSS), strictosidine glucosidase (SG), isopentenyl pyrophosphate isomerase (IPP isomerase) and geraniol 10-hydroxylase (G10H) of both cell lines were compared. The activities of TDC, SSS and IPP isomerase did not show a direct relationship with the biosynthetic capacity but SG and G10H might be limiting. In order to test whether the availability of the terpenoid precursor limits the biosynthesis of the terpenoid indole alkaloids, loganin was fed to the cultures. Loganin-feeding did not influence any of the measured enzyme activities but increased the terpenoid indole alkaloid accumulation of both cell lines to similar levels. A five-fold increase was observed for the accumulating line and a more than 100-fold increase for the low-accumulating one. Strictosidine accumulated mainly in the low-accumulating cell line which has high TDC and low SG activity; the amounts and types of the other terpenoid indole alkaloids which accumulated were similar in both lines.

After ultrasonographic detection of ovulation (day 0), a high-energy diet (12.55 MJ DE/kg diet; 125% of maintenance) was fed to TG from day 1 to day 4 after ovulation (4 days). The high-energy diet consisted of 850 g concentrate mixture and 150 g alfalfa hay, plus ad libitum access to wheat straw. The CG was offered as maintenance diet (10 MJ DE/kg diet) throughout the experiment. Follicular development was observed ultrasonographically every other day while blood samples were collected daily throughout the experiment for the analysis of glucose, total cholesterol, urea, triglycerides, total proteins, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT). Transient feeding of high-energy ration during early luteal phase of estrous cycle significantly influenced the concentration of glucose and some metabolic profiles. Total proteins were greater at first, third and fourth day after ovulation (ovulation is day 0) in TG when compared to CG ewes. Blood glucose concentration was greater in TG than that of CG at days 1, 2, 3 and 4 postovulation. The average number of small follicles (2\u20132.9 mm) of the first follicular wave after ovulation was greater in TG ewes (23.3 follicles) than that of CG (2.2). There was no difference in the number of medium (3\u20135 mm) and large sized follicles (>5 mm) between CG and TG ewes.

Test period survival was analyzed by a linear and a threshold model, while a linear repeatability model was used for analysis of test-day survival, and a proportional hazards Weibull model was applied to time until death. The threshold and the proportional hazards models resulted in the highest heritabilities (0.59 and 0.63, respectively), while the lowest heritability was found for the linear repeatability test-day model (0.02). The different models were ranked according to their ability to predict full-sib family survival to disease outbreak in the field. All models proved to be good predictors, with correlations between predicted full-sib family effects from challenge test and full-sib family field survival ranging from 0.71 to 0.75. The linear repeatability model had the best predictive ability, followed by the cross-sectional threshold model, the Weibull frailty model, and the cross-sectional linear model. The Weibull frailty model was unable to include common environmental family effects in addition to additive genetic effects of sire and dam, possibly reducing the predictive ability of this model.

In particular, studies of songbird reproductive output typically terminate with the success or failure of nests, despite the fact that adults spend the rest of the reproductive season rearing dependent fledglings. Unless fledgling survival does not vary, or varies consistently with nest productivity, conclusions about population dynamics based solely on nest data may be misleading. During 2007 and 2008, we monitored nests and used radio telemetry to monitor fledgling survival for a population of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) in a managed-forest landscape in north-central Minnesota, USA. In addition to estimating nest and fledgling survival, we modeled growth for population segments partitioned by proximity to edges of non-nesting cover types (regenerating clearcuts). Nest survival was significantly lower, but fledgling survival was significantly higher, in 2007 than in 2008. Despite higher nest productivity in 2008, seasonal productivity (number of young surviving to independence per breeding female) was higher in 2007. Proximity to clearcut edge did not affect nest productivity. However, fledglings from nests near regenerating sapling-dominated clearcuts (7\u201320 years since harvest) had higher daily survival (0.992 \u00b1 0.005) than those from nests in interior forest (0.978 \u00b1 0.006), which in turn had higher daily survival than fledglings from nests near shrub-dominated clearcuts (\u22646 years since harvest; 0.927 \u00b1 0.030) in 2007, with a similar but statistically non-significant trend in 2008. Our population growth models predicted growth rates that differed by 2\u201339% (x\u00af = 25%) from simpler models in which we replaced our estimates of first-year survival with one-half adult annual survival (an estimate commonly used in songbird population growth models). We conclude that nest productivity is an inadequate measure of songbird seasonal productivity, and that results based exclusively on nest data can yield misleading conclusions about population growth and clearcut edge effects.

Our results revealed highly diverse bacterial communities up to 900 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) estimated from each seawater which was collected in the month of March and May, when the environmental conditions including temperature differed significantly: 7.2\u00b0C and 17.6\u00b0C in March and May, respectively. Altogether, 13 bacterial phyla were recovered from the seawater, of which Proteobacteria was the most dominant group. In addition, the value of the Shannon index, which measures the evenness of the distribution of individuals among OTUs, in May is higher than that in March, indicating that it displays a wider diversity of bacteria. Interestingly, the proportion of pathogenic bacteria was significantly increased in the month of May compared to March, suggesting that pathogenic bacteria were increasingly emerging in May.

Retigabine interacts with the pore of KCNQ2-5 channels, requiring a Trp residue present in KCNQ2-5 to exert its effects, suggesting the notion of a hydrophobic binding pocket. We have used nonsense suppression to subtly alter the properties of this Trp residue (265) in homomeric KCNQ3 channels and identify the specific chemical interactions required for retigabine effects. Remarkably, simply changing the position of the indole nitrogen atom from Trp265 (removing its hydrogen bonding ability) completely abolishes the effects of retigabine. This finding suggests that retigabine interacts with KCNQ channels via a hydrogen bond with the Trp indole group, a rarely demonstrated mode of drug:target interaction. Supporting this model, substitution with fluorinated Trp analogs can strengthen retigabine potency by increasing the indole N-H bond polarity. Lastly, the potency of numerous retigabine analogs for KCNQ3 channels was found to correlate with the negative electrostatic surface potential of a conserved carbonyl oxygen atom. These findings demonstrate the detailed chemical interactions and functional groups that likely underlie the effects of retigabine and other KCNQ activators, highlighting a rarely observed mode of drug interaction with multifunctional amphipathic Trp side chains. These stringent constraints for models of retigabine interactions with KCNQ channels may guide the rational development of improved retigabine derivatives.", "year": 2015, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2014.11.136", "venue": null, "journal": "Biophysical Journal", "mag_id": "2057922826", "mag_field_of_study": ["Chemistry"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": [], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": false, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:84887397"}

Three plots (20 and 24 m 2 ) were used in each stand and were treated as follows; unharvested; two harvests per year; or three harvests per year. Harvesting two or three times per year affected the stands to about the same degree. The harvested biomass was significantly lower in Year 2 with 60 and 75% of that in the first year. In the harvested stands the rhizome biomass decreased significantly during the first year. There was a strong relationship between the amount of non-structural carbohydrates stored in the rhizomes in November of Year 1 and the number of shoots with basal diameter > 5 mm in June of Year 2. A lack of carbohydrates during shoot initiation seemed to result in thinner shoots. This effect may have been accentuated by a lack of N during late summer and autumn. During Year 1 the amount of N used for shoot growth was 40\u201380% higher than in the control plots, whereas in Year 2 the relationship was reversed.

P. pectinatus was raised from winter-collected tubers in aquatic microcosms and submitted to grazing by snails at various densities and starvation levels. 3 Newly sprouted P. pectinatus was much more sensitive to snail grazing than mature plants: survival of newly sprouted plants decreased as snail density increased, whereas the survival rate of mature plants was unaffected by snail density.

On the other hand, chelerythrine, a PKC inhibitor, enhanced the radiation-induced apoptosis. These results suggest that PKC plays a key role in the regulation of radiation-induced apoptosis in 3SBH5 cells. Irradiation alone had no effect on the distribution of PKC subtypes (\u03b1, \u03b2I, \u03b2II and \u03b4) in the 3SBH5 cells.

Pragmatically, this convention enables agnostics, theists and atheists to work together in common scientific tasks. Even the theist, who might be expected to have a vested interest in referring to God, can view the convention as a positive advantage. For, without it, a consistent theist would always have to give accounts of events in terms of divine agency as well as proximate physical causes; and this would be extremely cumbersome. Unless the policy be consistently applied, the theist risks giving the impression that God is at work only in some situations and not in others. This may develop into the theological confusion of the 'god-of-the-gaps', which portrays God as active only in areas where there are at present no scientific explanations. So, if this convention of silence about God can be viewed as having advantages all round, why break it? Part of the answer to this question is: because there is a growing tendency for others to do so in certain branches of physics and in so doing to make assertions which stand in need of comment. Another part of the answer is that, despite the convention that talk of God has no place in science, theistic questions do arise within an educational context. Pupils and students ask questions about science-and-religion from time to time and they expect nonevasive answers. Their informal learning, arising out of television and the popular writings of experts, often has a component of philosophical and religious ideas.

Its lambda-dependent optical continuum morphology is compact with linear size approximately 10-35 kpc (H0 = 50, q0 = 0). In redshifted Ly-alpha, the galaxy is somewhat more extended (less-than-or-similar-to 67 kpc x 40 kpc). Its radio source is 7 times smaller than, and confined by, the Ly-alpha gas. It shows alignment with the Ly-alpha gas and the best seeing optical continuum images. We present nine-band photometry (Ly-alpha U BgriJHK) for the galaxy as well as surrounding objects. The source 53W002 is not variable on time scales of years, in either radio or optical. We compare its rest-frame UV continuum with IUE spectra of various nearby galaxies with relatively recent starbursts, and nearby active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The C IV/Ly-alpha and N v/Ly-alpha ratios suggest that 53W002 has a Seyfert 1-like AGN, and constrain the nonthermal component to be approximately 35% of the observed UV continuum. Several independent age estimates yield a consistent value of 0.25-0.32 Gyr: (1) its small 4000 angstrom break or UV-visual continuum amplitude compared with nearby galaxies; (2) a best model fit to the downturn of its UV spectrum below approximately 2000 angstrom; (3) limits from the lack of detected stellar absorption features; (4) its total stellar mass (from its V- and K-band luminosity) compared with its SFR [from W-lambda (Ly-alpha, z = 0)]. These parameters together suggest that at z = 2.390, 53W002 had processed only a few times 10(11) M. into stars, significantly less than most powerful radio galaxies have converted into stars at z approximately 2-3.8. Hence, star formation in 53W002 has proceeded slower, and started at a later epoch, than in the most powerful high-redshift radio galaxies. The available data are consistent with 53W002 being a genuinely young (radio) galaxy seen at z = 2.390 during its first major starburst. It likely started forming most of its current stars at redshifts 2.5-3.0 (for H0 = 50-100, q0 = 0.0-0.5). This suggests that (radio) galaxies do not form the bulk of their stars coevally, but start doing so over a wide range of cosmic time.", "year": 1991, "arxiv_id": null, "acl_id": null, "pmc_id": null, "pubmed_id": null, "doi": "10.1086/170596", "venue": null, "journal": "The Astrophysical Journal", "mag_id": "2083609040", "mag_field_of_study": ["Physics"], "outbound_citations": [], "inbound_citations": ["121308495"], "has_outbound_citations": false, "has_inbound_citations": true, "has_pdf_parse": false, "s2_url": "https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:123623740"}

This is the goal of papers by Shapiro, Khavinson and Shapiro, Sakai, and Gustafsson, where the authors approach the subject inRn by different methods.
